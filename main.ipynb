      "Updated January 1st, 2025\n",
      "Are you looking for an easy guide on\n",
      "how to start a blog\n",
      "?\n",
      "The step-by-step guide on this page will show you how to create a blog in 20 minutes with\n",
      "just the most basic computer skills.\n",
      "After completing this guide you will have a beautiful blog that is ready to share with the world.\n",
      "This guide is made especially for beginners.  I will walk you through each and every step, using plenty of pictures and videos to make it all perfectly clear.\n",
      "If you get stuck or have questions at any point, simply\n",

      "and I will do my best to help you out.\n",
      "Ready to start?\n",
      "Click here to skip the intro and start building your blog now\n",
      "My name is Scott Chow, and I am going to show you how to start blogging today. I have been building blogs and websites since 2002. In that time I have launched several of my own blogs, and helped hundreds of others do the same.\n",
      "I know that starting a blog can seem overwhelming and intimidating.\n",
      "This free guide is all about blogging for beginners\n",
      ", and will teach you how to become a blogger with just the most basic computer skills. So whether you’re 8 or 88, you can create your own blog in 20 minutes.\n",
      "I am not ashamed to admit that when I was first learning how to build a blog I made a ton of mistakes. You can benefit from more than a decade of my experience so that you don’t repeat these same mistakes when you make your own blog. I created this free guide so that a complete beginner can learn how to blog quickly and easily.\n",
      "So, just\n",
      "how do you start a blog?\n",
      "Learn how to create a blog in about 20 minutes following these steps:\n",
      "How to Start a Blog in 6 Steps\n",
      "Pick a blog name.\n",
      "Choose a descriptive name for your blog.\n",
      "Get your blog online.\n",
      "Register your blog and get hosting.\n",
      "Customize your blog.\n",
      "Choose a free blog design template and tweak it.\n",
      "Write & publish your first post.\n",
      "Share your thoughts with the world. The fun part!\n",
      "Promote your blog.\n",
      "Get more people to read your blog with the proper marketing.\n",
      "Make money blogging.\n",
      "Choose from several options to monetize your blog.\n",
      "Should you start a blog?\n",
      "One of the misconceptions about starting a blog is that you need to be a great writer to be successful. Nothing could be further from the truth. People read blog sites to get a personal perspective on things, so most bloggers write in a very informal and conversational style.\n",
      "And because of the format, many successful bloggers will\n",
      "write about a variety of topics\n",
      "on the same blog.\n",
      "In addition, you don’t need to be an expert on any of the topics you write about to have a successful blog. For example, visitors to a cooking blog don’t want to read a textbook from a food scientist, they want to hear the experiences of someone who has actually cooked some real meals, mistakes and all.\n",
      "To be successful as a blogger there is really just one requirement: a passion for your topic.\n",
      "At its heart, blogging is about sharing your knowledge with the world. Writing about things that you are passionate about makes the process of starting a successful blog so much easier. As long as you are writing about things that you are genuinely interested in, your passion will shine through and keep your visitors interested.\n",
      "So why would you go to the trouble of blogging? There are a few reasons:\n",
      "Share your story.\n",
      "A blog allows you to have a voice and be heard. You can share your story with the entire world if you so choose. One of the most common ways blogs are used are as a diary where the blogger writes about their daily experiences so that friends, family, and others can all be a part of their lives.\n",
      "Make money from home.\n",
      "Blogging can be quite lucrative if done correctly. The top bloggers in the world obviously earn quite a bit, but even a part-time blogger can expect to make a nice profit if things are done correctly. The best part about it is that blogging is a form of passive income, since you can spend just a few hours a week writing a piece of content and then continue to profit from it long after the the writing is finished. I go into much more detail on how to blog for money later in this guide.\n",
      "Recognition for yourself or your business.\n",
      "No, you probably won’t have paparazzi following you around because of your latest post. But a successful blog makes your idea into a reality, and can gain you a ton of recognition in your respective field. Many bloggers are known as experts just because of their blogs, and some have even gotten book and movie deals based on their blogs.\n",
      "Find a community.\n",
      "Blogging at its heart is interactive. You write a post and people comment on it. This is a good way to connect with people who are interested in the same things as you are. Blogging allows you to teach these people based on your experience, and it gives you the opportunity to learn from your readers as well.\n",
      "Ready to begin?\n",
      "Click here to go to Step #1 of the guide\n",
      "What is a blog anyway?\n",
      "In short,\n",
      "a blog is a type of website that focuses mainly on written content\n",
      ", also known as blog posts. In popular culture we most often hear about news blogs or celebrity blog sites, but as you’ll see in this guide, you can start a successful blog on just about any topic imaginable.\n",
      "Bloggers often write from a personal perspective that allows them to connect directly with their readers. In addition, most blogs also have a “comments” section where visitors can correspond with the blogger. Interacting with your visitors in the comments section helps to further the connection between the blogger and the reader.\n",
      "This direct connection to the reader is one of the main benefits of starting a blog. This connection allows you to interact and share ideas with other like-minded people. It also allows you to build trust with your readers. Having the trust and loyalty of your readers also opens up the door to making money from your blog, which is something I discuss later in this guide.\n",
      "The good news is that the internet is exploding with growth right now. More people than ever are online. This explosion in growth means more potential readers for your blog. In short, if you are thinking about starting a blog then there is no better time than right now.\n",
      "Let’s start your blog!\n",
      "Step 1: Pick a blog name\n",
      "If you are not sure what to name your blog, or what topic to blog about, skip to the\n",
      "next section\n",
      ".\n",
      "If you’ve already got an idea for the name of your blog, you can check to make sure that no one else has already registered it:\n",
      "See if your blog name is available:\n",
      "Note: You cannot use any spaces or punctuation other than dashes in a domain name.\n",
      "If you find that the name you wanted is already taken there are a few things you can do:\n",
      "Try a different domain extension.\n",
      "If the .com version is already registered you may still be able to get the .net or .org version of the name.\n",
      "Add small words.\n",
      "Words like “a”, “my”, “best”, or “the”. For example, this site is called TheBlogStarter.com instead of BlogStarter.com.\n",
      "Add dashes between words.\n",
      "For example, scott-chow.com\n",
      "How to Choose a Blog Topic & Name\n",
      "If you don’t have an idea for a name already, the first step is choosing your blog topic.\n",
      "If you’re not sure what to blog about, there are\n",
      "a few ways to find a good blog topic\n",
      ":\n",
      "Life experiences.\n",
      "Everyone has lessons they have learned through life experience. Sharing this knowledge can be incredibly helpful to others in similar situations.\n",
      "For example, I recently helped a woman start her blog about being a fireman’s wife. She has a lot of experience and knowledge to share with others about this topic, and it has helped her connect with others in similar situations.\n",
      "Think about the things you have experienced in life. This could be related to your family (example: a blog about being a stay at home mom), work (a blog about experiences dealing with clients), or other life experiences (a blog about dealing with a troubling time such as a disease or divorce, or about a happy time such as preparing for a wedding or a birth of a child).\n",
      "A personal blog.\n",
      "A personal blog is a blog all about you. This will include a variety of topics, from things you do on a daily basis, to random thoughts and musings. This is a great way to share your thoughts with the world without having to stick to just one topic.\n",
      "Hobbies & passions.\n",
      "Hobbies or other interests you are passionate about are a great place to start. Cooking, travel, fashion, sports, and cars are all classic examples. But even blogs about more obscure hobbies can be successful, since the your audience is literally anyone in the world with the internet.\n",
      "Once you have a topic it’s time to choose your blog name, also known as your domain name.\n",
      "A good blog name should be descriptive\n",
      "so that potential visitors can instantly tell what your blog is about just from the name.\n",
      "If you are blogging about one specific topic then you will definitely want to include that in some way when you pick a domain name. Try not to get hung-up on just one word though. For example, a cooking blog doesn’t necessarily have to have the word “cooking” in it. The words “food”, “recipes”, and “meals” would also let people know that your blog is about cooking.\n",
      "If you are planning to create a personal blog where you discuss a variety of topics then I recommend using your name, or some variation of it, since your blog is all about you. For example, I own the blog scottchow.com. You can also add your middle name or middle initial if you find your name is already taken. Or you could use a variation like “Scott Chow Blog” or “Blogging with Scott”.\n",
      "Can’t decide on a good name for your blog?\n",
      "Contact me\n",
      "and I will help you personally (for free)!\n",
      "Once you have some name ideas you will need to\n",
      "choose a domain extension\n",
      ".\n",
      "A .com domain extension is the most preferred, but .net or .org work as well. It is also important to note that for the purposes of a blog domain you cannot have any spaces between words.\n",
      "So “Blogging with Scott” becomes bloggingwithscott.com\n",
      "Step 2: Get your blog online\n",
      "Now that you’ve got a name picked out it’s time to get your blog online. This might sound hard or technical, but the steps below will walk you right through and\n",
      "make the process easy\n",
      ".\n",
      "To get your blog up and running you need two things: blog hosting (also known as web hosting) and blogging software. The good news is that these typically come packaged together.\n",
      "A blog host is a company that stores all of the files for your blog and delivers them to the user when they type in your blog name.\n",
      "You must have a blog host in order to have a blog\n",
      ".\n",
      "You also need to have the software to build your blog. In this guide I will be showing you how to build a blog using the WordPress blogging software, because it is the most popular, customizable, and easiest to use.\n",
      "The web host I recommend, and the one I show you how to use in this guide, is\n",
      "BlueHost\n",
      ". I personally use BlueHost and I recommend them for all new bloggers because:\n",
      "They will\n",

      "if you are unsatisfied for any reason.\n",
      "They offer a free, automatic installation of the WordPress blogging software (which I show you how to use in this guide).\n",
      "They offer\n",

      "Bluehost.com\n",
      "and click “Login” on the top right to bring up the login screen.  You can then login using your domain name and the password you set in the previous step.  If you have misplaced your password you can reset it by clicking the “Forgot Password” link.\n",
      "Once you log-in you will be taken to your BlueHost Portal.  From the portal you can click the blue “WordPress” button to be logged-in automatically to your WordPress blog.\n",
      "Changing your blog design\n",
      "Once you login you will be in the WordPress dashboard. This is where you can make any changes you want to your blog.\n",
      "Everyone has a different idea of how they want their blog to look. One of the great things about WordPress is that you can change your entire layout and design with just a few clicks.\n",
      "In WordPress, blog layouts are known as “Themes”. What is a blog theme? Themes control the entire design of your WordPress blog. To change your theme you are going to click on the “Appearance” tab on the left menu.\n",
      "You will see several free WordPress themes are already installed on your blog: Twenty Twenty-Four, Twenty Twenty-Five, etc. These are well-designed, clean-looking themes that can work for just about any type of blog. In fact, many of the world’s top bloggers use one of these themes.\n",
      "Unless you have a very specific design in mind for your blog,\n",
      "I suggest you use one of these themes to start with\n",
      ". For our example, let’s use the “Twenty Twenty-Five” WordPress theme. In order to activate the theme on your blog, hover over the theme and click the “Activate” button. That’s it! You have changed the entire design of your blog with just one click!\n",
      "If you don’t like any of the themes that are already installed you can easily choose from thousands of other free WordPress themes. To install a new WordPress theme, click on the “Appearance” tab on the left menu and then click “Add New Theme”.\n",
      "This is the WordPress theme search screen.  There are thousands of themes to choose from.  You can change your entire design at anytime simply by activating a new WordPress theme.  To find a theme you like, I suggest you click on the “Popular” tab and start browsing. When you find one that you like you can hover over it and then click the blue “Install” button.\n",
      "Once the theme is installed click “Activate” to activate the theme on your blog. To see your new theme in action, go to your blog and take a look!\n",

      "Now that your blog is up and running it’s time to actually do some blogging!  Let’s create your first piece of content.\n",
      "Go to the left menu and click on “Posts”.\n",
      "You will see there is already a post there. This is a default post on every new WordPress blog, and we don’t need it. To delete it click “Trash” just under the post.\n",
      "To begin writing a new post, click the “Add New Post” link.\n",

      "Once you have finished your post just click the “Publish” button on the top right side of the screen to publish the new post.\n",
      "Content That Should be on Your Blog\n",
      "There are two main types of content your blog should provide: static and dynamic content.\n",
      "Static Content:\n",
      "Your blog should contain a few necessary pages explicitly designed to provide the visitor with the tools they need. The content on these pages is static, meaning – the content doesn’t change, or at least not very often. These are mainly top-level pages that can be accessed via a menu on your blog.\n",
      "These static content pages should be in place well before you launch your blog to the world.\n",
      "Important static pages to include:\n",
      "About Me (Us)\n",
      "– This page should include a biographical summary of the author(s) as well as a mission statement. Think about the answers to these questions:\n",
      "How did your passion for the subject matter develop?\n",
      "What do you want to convey to the world?\n",
      "What is your ultimate goal?\n",
      "Contact Me (Us)\n",
      "– A contact page provides the visitor a place to reach the author which, in turn, provides the visitor with the reassurance that you are a real and reachable author. You can add your physical address, phone number, and custom email address. Or you can utilize a simple contact form to keep your personal identifying information private. You should put links to all of your social media profiles here as well.\n",
      "Aside from your blog, which is generally introduced on the home/main page, these two all-important pages should be visible on your top (header) menu and easy to access.  You can take a look at the top of this page to see how I have these pages included in the header menu.\n",
      "See this detailed guide to customizing your blog menus\n",
      "if you need help.\n",

Common static page examples are an advertising page to solicit paid advertisements, a donations page, a resource page to direct visitors to your favorite links within your field, and a page for submitting ideas and content.\n",
      "Dynamic Content:\n",
      "Your dynamic content is your blog and the most important content you have to offer. This is where you, as the creator, will infuse the blog with your brand of informative content that supplies your audience with knowledgeable tips, facts, opinions, and stories. This is how you engage your visitors and keep them coming back for more.\n",
      "Your blog content should be regularly submitted at specific intervals. Waiting months to create content will never build a following. Posting content weekly and driving traffic to these posts will help build your brand.\n",
      "How to write great blog content\n",
      "Each post should be lengthy, informative, and engaging. It’s not always easy to come up with new blog post ideas on a regular basis and you are free to mix up the tone and even the subject matter to keep things lively and interesting. It’s your space, after all. But there are a few elements that each and every piece of content should endeavor to include.\n",
      "Define the Content:\n",
      "Create an alluring post title that stimulates curiosity and encourages clicks. Use the first paragraph of your post to clearly define the topic of your article and provide a possible hook to keep the reader reading.\n",
      "The Longer the Better – But Break It Up\n",
      ": The more information and detail you include, the better. But visitors will begin to skim if the content contains lengthy paragraphs a mile long, and will pop out faster than they came in. Visitors enjoy tidbits. Keep your paragraphs short with spaces in between, use lists and standout quotes, use images, and always include headings and sub-headings so that visitors can find what they’re looking for.\n",
      "Engage The Reader:\n",
      "At the end of each post, a common tactic used to engage visitors is posing a meaningful question to your audience and asking them to reply in the comments. This simple measure can increase engagement tenfold.\n",
      "Original Content:\n",
      "Your content should always be original. Never plagiarize – you will eventually be called out on it and could even face consequences. Your content should come from your heart, your brain, your knowledge base, and your experience. You can get topic ideas from others in your field, but make sure the content comes from you.\n",
      "Original Photos:\n",
      "While it is easy to include stock images from free image sites, it is even better to include your own photos and graphic work. Another idea is to take free images and manipulate them with a free photo editor.\n",
      "Edit Your Work:\n",
      "Your blog content should be sufficiently edited. Nothing says unprofessional like several typographical and grammatical errors. If you need a few refresher courses in grammar, consider using a writing application.\n",
      "Publishing Your Blog\n",
      "Even after you have written a post your blog may still be showing a placeholder page.\n",

      "Congratulations! You now know how to start your own blog and publish content!\n",
      "Step 5: Promote your blog\n",
      "Creating a well-designed blog and writing great content is just the start. In order to get visitors to your blog you will need spend some time promoting it, especially when you first start.\n",
      "The strategies below will help get your blog in front of more readers. You don’t need to use every strategy – try out a few and see what works well for you.\n",
      "Alert Your Inner Circle\n",
      "The very first people who should become aware of your blog are your inner circle. This includes family, friends, and colleagues within your field. Encourage them to become followers, ask them to mention your new blog, and – most importantly – thank them.\n",
      "Use Social Media\n",
      "While you don’t want to overdo it, you still want to create accounts with the “biggies” like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest, and Instagram.  You should post a link to your newest content on your accounts, but you can also post relevant news and links to other sources that your readers may find interesting.  Don’t forget to use hashtags and engage with your followers!\n",
      "One of my favorite ways to get visitors to my blog is to post links on my social accounts, like Facebook and Twitter. This is great, because not only do your friends see the link, but if your friends share the link with their friends it automatically multiplies your visitors. If you have created high-quality content on your blog then social media is a way for your blog to go viral.\n",
      "Comment on Other Blogs\n",
      "Find other blogs in your community and engage with them. Using the comment section, introduce yourself and leave engaging and constructive comments. Many will allow you to leave a link to your blog. After creating relationships with prominent bloggers in your community, you will find yourself within their ranks quickly.\n",
      "Engage with Your Visitors\n",
      "When your readers leave comments on your posts, always engage with them. Reply to their comments and questions, give them “likes” and affirmations. When it is obvious that the author cares about his/her community and readership, visitors are naturally encouraged to return.\n",
      "Collaborate with other bloggers\n",
      "Become enmeshed in your blogging community by collaborating with respected members of your field. Collaborating includes guest posting, promoting each other’s blogs and products, and regularly interacting through comments and social media.\n",
      "Post Regularly\n",
      "Post content regularly. Create an editorial calendar and stick to it. A good blogger posts at least once per week to start. If you have long lapses between posts, your followers will drop off and your growth will be severely hampered. It’s not easy to post on a schedule, but it’s something you absolutely must stick to.\n",
      "Create an Email List\n",
      "In addition to getting new visitors to your blog, you will also want to make sure your current visitors are coming back. This is where email marketing plays a big role. By collecting the email addresses of your visitors (with their permission of course), you can then notify them when you post new content on your blog. This keeps people coming back to your blog, which not only gives you more readers over time, it also allows you to build a closer relationship with your visitors.\n",

      "To optimize this process, each page of your blog should include these fundamental elements:\n",
      "Header Tags:\n",
      "Section headings and subheadings should be wrapped in header tags.  To do this, click on the left item of the block you are writing in and change it to “Heading”.  You can then choose from H1, H2, H3, etc.\n",
      "Categorization:\n",
      "Your content should be clearly categorized into specific and relevant categories.  In the post editor screen, click on “Document” on the right menu, and then go down to “Categories” and “Add New Category”.\n",
      "Permalinks:\n",
      "Each blog post “slug” is the end portion of the URL. You want to make sure each post has a defined slug and doesn’t end with an article number. You can easily change this in your WordPress dashboard by going to “Settings” -> “Permalinks”. Select the “Post Name” option and click “Save Changes”\n",

      "Once you have put in the effort of creating great blog content and promoting your blog, making money from your blog is actually the easy part.\n",
      "Blogs have the potential to be extremely lucrative, but don’t assume that you’re going to start making money in the first week, or even in the first month. It could take six months to a year to start seeing a steady stream of income. Blogging takes work and dedication, but once you develop a large enough audience, there are several methods you can employ to monetize your blog.\n",
      "Sell advertising space\n",
      "Once you have a popular blog, advertisers will be hounding you for the opportunity to advertise. The best way to take advantage of this situation is to use Google Adsense. Google finds the advertisers for you and all you have to do is place the Google Adsense code on your blog to start running ads. Google Adsense takes all of the hard work out of the process and just cuts you a check.\n",
      "I go into the full details of\n",
      "how to set up Google Adsense for your WordPress blog here\n",
      ".\n",
      "Sell affiliate products\n",
      "An affiliate program is a commission-based way to advertise. When one of your readers clicks on a link on your blog, they get sent to an advertiser’s site and you earn a commission if they purchase. Affiliate links are a nice way to earn income through the use of product reviews. However, you must remember to disclose that you are an affiliate for the product.\n",
      "Sell Products and Services\n",
      "Selling your own products and services directly on your blog is a great way to increase your income. As your blog grows and you begin to see a wide audience, your products and services will begin to sell themselves.\n",
      "Use the sidebar of your blog to increase the visibility of what you sell using visual images and a link to your storefront page.\n",
      "Sell digital downloads\n",
      "Ebooks, video tutorials, and e-courses are the most commonly consumed digital materials sold by bloggers. With little to no overhead and no shipping costs, you can keep the price low and inviting.\n",
      "If you are extremely knowledgeable in your field, an ebook can practically write itself. Give it a try, you might surprise yourself!\n",
      "Sell memberships\n",
      "Another way to monetize is by creating membership options on your blog. This allows you to offer members more exclusive content only available with a paid membership. For example, you could offer unlimited downloads of digital goods, free consultations, a private network or forum where community members can mix and mingle, and private content available to members only.\n",
      "There are many ways a blog can capitalize on popularity and traffic. Choosing the way you monetize from your blog depends on your goals and the purpose of your blog. Those who are selling services, physical goods, and digital goods, for example, may not want to participate in affiliate programs where traffic could be lost to another site.\n",

      ", or leave a comment below.\n",
      "Click on a question to read the answer:\n",
      "What makes a successful blog?\n",
      "You. It is your passion, your creativity, your knowledge and expertise, and what you bring to the community that makes a blog successful. As long as you provide content that is interesting, informative, and engaging to the readers you’re looking to connect with, your success is only limited by the number of posts you’re able to produce.\n",
      "Keep writing, keep interacting, keep engaging, and your blog quickly become one of the success stories. As long as you’re passionate about the subject matter, the sky is the limit.\n",
      "What do you need to start a blog?\n",
      "Time, passion, and a clear goal.\n",
      "Blogging is nearly a full-time operation. A successful blogger commits to posting lengthy and detailed content at least weekly. Promoting the blog must also be done regularly across social accounts and through peer interactions.\n",
      "Equally important is the passion behind your blog. To come up with great content on a regular basis your blog should revolve around a topic that you are obsessed with. You don’t have to be the leading authority on the subject matter. You only need to possess passion, excitement, dedication, and deeply rooted opinions.\n",
      "You also need a clear goal in mind. What is the main objective of your blog? Is it to inform the public? To eventually retain paid subscribers? With a clear final objective you can grow a blog that satisfies these goals in the long term.\n",
      "What should my blog be about?\n",
      "Answer these questions:\n",
      "What are you passionate about? What do you think about daily? What topic do you annoy all of your friends, family, and co-workers with on a regular basis? What do you find yourself dreaming about? What do you find yourself constantly researching? What do you read about?\n",
      "If there is a common denominator in your answers to these questions – THAT is what your blog should be about.\n",
      "Your blog should be about what interests you – what you’re passionate about. And once you begin to build your blog, no matter what the subject material, you will find a community of people who are interested in what you have to say.\n",
      "How do I find a profitable niche for my blog?\n",
      "If you know the general topic for your blog, a simple way of making your niche more profitable is by narrowing the niche to eliminate competition.\n",
      "For example, let’s say you’re passionate about food and you want to start by creating a recipe blog. You’ll be competing with a million recipe blogs. So let’s narrow that topic down to something that is more manageable yet still important to a lot of people. Making the topic of your blog more specific will help to eliminate a lot of competition and elevate your blog results in search engines for more specific queries.\n",
      "How do I name my blog?\n",
      "This can ultimately be a fun exercise.\n",
      "As an example, let’s say your blog will be about custom pet gift baskets. In this instance, let’s list all the main words this blog will be about.\n",
      "Now let’s list some variant synonyms of these words. Use a thesaurus if need be!\n",
      "Now list nouns and adjectives that apply to you as the creator.\n",
      "Now start putting words together, introduce new words, and keep playing around until you come up with a name you like!\n",
      "If you are still struggling you can always try using a blog name generator for additional ideas.\n",
      "What do you do if your domain name is taken?\n",
      "If the domain name you want is taken and the full web address is your trademarked business name, you can assert your trademark rights and privileges and eventually get this domain handed over to you. It is a lengthy process that will involve lawyers and hefty fees, but as long as the name is trademarked by you, you would likely win the domain name.\n",
      "If your name isn’t trademarked, don’t attempt to buy the .info or .biz variation of the domain. Instead, try a slight variation of the domain name such as adding a dash between words, or inserting the word “the” or other nominal words.\n",
      "In some cases, the domain is owned but isn’t being used. Trying searching for it in the browser. If the URL is pointed to a different domain, it isn’t being used, only redirected. You may be able to buy the domain for the right price from the current owner. If the domain is parked, you may also attempt to purchase the domain.\n",
      "Where is the best place to create a blog?\n",
      "In the tutorial on this page I show you how to create your blog using\n",
      "BlueHost\n",
      "and\n",
      "WordPress.org\n",
      ".  This is known as a self-hosted WordPress blog, and it is what I personally use for this blog and it’s what I recommend to all my readers.  When you sign-up with BlueHost you get a free domain name, they will automatically install WordPress (WordPress.org) on your BlueHost account. You can begin blogging as soon as your account is set up. You can easily customize your self-hosted WordPress blog just by following the steps in the tutorial on this page.\n",
      "How much does it cost to start a blog?\n",
      "You can make a blog for absolutely nothing. It doesn’t cost one red cent.\n",
      "But let’s be realistic. If you want your blog to be taken seriously, you can’t just get a subdomain from one of the free blogging sites like Blogspot. You’ll want to pick a custom domain name and register it instead. Domain names cost around $15 per year, on average. So now you’re a whopping $15 in the hole.\n",
      "But the best way to start your blog is through one of the many web hosting companies. The best web hosting choice is a WordPress hosting account through\n",
      "Bluehost\n",
      "which is $1.99 per month and includes free domain name registration, so your total cost for 1 year is just $33.\n",
      "These are your main costs associated with starting a successful blog. Of course, you may incur other costs with additional services such as email marketing. As with any business, the biggest expenditure is often advertising, but this would be a cost incurred later on down the road if you choose to go that route.\n",
      "Do bloggers make money?\n",
      "Bloggers have the ability to make a full-time income from blogging alone. Some bloggers make hundreds of thousands of dollars. While it isn’t easy to become a highly paid blogger, it is quite possible. As with any business, it takes a lot of hard work and plenty of time.\n",
      "Many bloggers give up on their project after just a few months. They become discouraged when the money doesn’t come in right away, and it almost never does without an instant and immediate following that comes from being a high profile persona. Therefore, time and patience are needed to reach “influencer” status. Those who make money online are the ones who stick with it.\n",
      "There are several ways a blogger can earn money:\n",
      "Advertisements\n",
      ":\n",
      "As your blog gains traction and brings in a healthy amount of daily visitors, advertisers may pay good money for a well-placed ad on your blog.\n",
      "Contextual Ads:\n",
      "With Google Adsense a small piece of code can be placed on your blog that dynamically shows ads related to your content. When one of your readers clicks on an ad the advertiser pays Google, and Google sends you a percentage.\n",
      "Affiliate Programs:\n",
      "Affiliate ads are a very popular way to monetize a blog. These ads lead visitors to a product or service on another website. If a sale resulting from a click on your blog is made, you get a commission, and some commissions can be very high. Affiliate programs can be found on individual stores, or on large-scale platforms such as Amazon.\n",
      "Sponsored Posts:\n",
      "Advertisers can pay a smaller fee to sponsor individual posts rather than advertising on the entire blog. This is a great method for making money on fledgling blogs.\n",
      "How do bloggers get paid?\n",
      "Bloggers are most commonly paid by advertisers. How the blogger is paid varies depending on what type of ads are used.\n",
      "CPC:\n",
      "CPC or “Cost Per Click” ads generate revenue simply through clicks. CPC ads are generally highly targeted and rotational. Ads appear on specific blog posts and are related to the content of that post. The number of clicks you generate, which trends upward as your traffic increases, will ultimately determine the amount you are paid.\n",
      "Flat Fee:\n",
      "If a blog’s traffic is high, advertisers may pay a monthly flat fee for ad space on the blog’s website. That ad space could appear all over the website, within a section, or just a few pages. The money comes directly from the advertiser.\n",
      "Commission\n",
      ":\n",
      "Ads from an affiliate network use affiliate links. These links track visitors that come from your blog to the advertiser’s site. If a purchase is made by a visitor who originated from your blog, you receive a commission.\n",
      "Should I start my blog on WordPress?\n",
      "If you’re new to blogging and you don’t have much experience with HTML or coding, then yes – self-hosting a WordPress blog is the best choice for you!\n",
      "When it comes time to choose a blogging platform, the pros turn to WordPress.  And even though WordPress is used by millions of smaller blogs, it also powers many of the biggest sites on the internet.  In fact, WordPress is the most popular CMS (Content Management System) in the world with over 75 million blogs and websites currently using it. And there are many reasons why:\n",
      "Easy to Use\n",
      ":\n",
      "WordPress is remarkably easy to use. Theme customizers help to easily design your blog, change colors, and add images. Once your design is complete, all you need to do is write your content. The internal blog editor records your posts and displays them for you.\n",
      "Blog Anywhere\n",
      ": As long as you have Internet access, you can edit your WordPress blog and write new posts. WordPress provides you with an administrative backend where you may log in and work on your blog from anywhere in the world using a PC, Mac, tablet, or smartphone.\n",
      "You Don’t Need To Know How to Code\n",
      ":\n",
      "WordPress gives you easy tools to set up a blog that looks stunning without knowing a single line of HTML code or hiring a web developer. This makes WordPress a great option for those who don’t want to deal with technical issues.\n",
      "Built-in SEO\n",
      ": Google favors blogs built with WordPress. The out-of-the-box SEO (Search Engine Optimization) which comes packed with WordPress delivers impressive results over time in search engines. This translates to more readers for your blog.\n",
      "Free Themes\n",
      ": The WordPress CMS is connected to a repository where thousands of free themes (blog layouts) are available to browse and upload. Directly from the backend of your blog you can browse a multitude of themes with varying styles and functionality. These free WordPress themes can be installed with one click, and then easily customized by a total beginner.\n",
      "Is WordPress free?\n",
      "Yes! A self-hosted WordPress blog is a open-source, which is completely free. And there are two different WordPress options, both free, but\n",
      "COMPLETELY\n",
      "different, which you should be aware of.  Choosing between them is one of the most crucial decisions you will make.\n",
      "WordPress.org\n",
      ": This option is completely, 100% free.  WordPress.org is the blog platform I show you how to use in the tutorial on this page.  While it is completely free to download, it doesn’t run on its own. You will need a web host (see the\n",
      "step-by-step guide\n",
      ") and you’ll also need to buy a new domain name. Because you need your own web hosting plan, this option is known as a self-hosted WordPress blog. So while WordPress is technically free, there are fees involved with getting your new self-hosted WordPress blog up and running (less than $3 per month).\n",
      "WordPress.com\n",
      ": WordPress.com is a different platform that lets the user create a free blog on a subdomain of WordPress.com. While it does technically let you blog for free, if you would like to enable some basic options, or have your own domain, you will have to upgrade your account to a paid plan.  For this and other reasons, I don’t recommend WordPress.com.\n",
      "How often should I blog?\n",
      "If your goal is to eventually make money from your blog, you’ll want to start blogging as often as possible – at least once per week. Blogging can be casual if your goal is solely for personal pleasure. But if you’re seeking a large audience and wish to become a leader in your field, blogging weekly is a must.\n",
      "While frequency is important, it should not come at the expense of quality.  Not every piece of content needs be 2,000 words, but all of your posts should be informative and of value to your audience. This is no easy feat. However, if you’re able to stick with blogging on a regular schedule, it will become easier! As with anything else, the more you do it – the more skilled at it you become.\n",
      "Blogging weekly also helps improve your traffic from search engines, which you can track in your Google Analytics account. When you first begin blogging your latest posts will take time to show up on search engines. As you continue to post regularly you will naturally have more blog posts showing up in the search results, which means more traffic to your blog.\n",
      "Why do blogs fail?\n",
      "Almost any blog has the potential to become a success, yet most blogs fail. And there are many reasons why. Here are the most common reasons why a blog fails:\n",
      "Giving Up Too Fast\n",
      "– The most common reason why a blog fails is simply that the content creator gives up before his or her blog even has a chance to become recognized. Before you begin a blog, you should realize that most blogs take months and even years to gain traction. It’s quite an investment. If you fail to gain visitors or make money within a month don’t stop!  Continue to focus on creating quality content and getting your name out there via social media and networking.\n",
      "Intermittent Blogging\n",
      "– When there are long “silent periods” between posts it is difficult to build a solid following. People looking for information on your topic usually want a steady stream of new information to keep them interested. When a blog fails to deliver fresh and updated content people get bored and look elsewhere.\n",
      "Poor Content\n",
      "– Some bloggers think they can beat the system with auto-generated content or with duplicate content that is reworded. Readers know fluff when they read it. They know when an article has absolutely no value or when it is simply clickbait. A blog with poor content will never be successful.\n",
      "Too Many Ads\n",
      "– Blogs with dozens of ads obscuring most of the content will deter visitors from returning. People don’t come to your blog to be visually harassed by ill-placed, blinking advertisements. They come for information. While ads a good option to monetize, don’t overdo it.\n",

      "Hey Scott. I really appreciate the info, however, both you and BlueHost advertise the cost as “monthly.” When I went to sign up, it gave me a total cost which was the total cost for the contract. Before I give my payment information, I’d like to clarify if I’m paying monthly for the service, or if I have to pay a lump sum. Thanks.\n",

I will walk you through each and every step, using plenty of pictures and videos to make it all perfectly clear.\\nIf you get stuck or have questions at any point, simply\\nsend me a message\\nand I will do my best to help you out.\\nReady to start?\\nClick here to skip the intro and start building your blog now\\nMy name is Scott Chow, and I am going to show you how to start blogging today. I have been building blogs and websites since 2002. In that time I have launched several of my own blogs, and helped hundreds of others do the same.\\nI know that starting a blog can seem overwhelming and intimidating.\\nThis free guide is all about blogging for beginners\\n, and will teach you how to become a blogger with just the most basic computer skills. So whether you’re 8 or 88, you can create your own blog in 20 minutes.\\nI am not ashamed to admit that when I was first learning how to build a blog I made a ton of mistakes. You can benefit from more than a decade of my experience so that you don’t repeat these same mistakes when you make your own blog. I created this free guide so that a complete beginner can learn how to blog quickly and easily.\\nSo, just\\nhow do you start a blog?\\nLearn how to create a blog in about 20 minutes following these steps:\\nHow to Start a Blog in 6 Steps\\nPick a blog name.\\nChoose a descriptive name for your blog.\\nGet your blog online.\\nRegister your blog and get hosting.\\nCustomize your blog.\\nChoose a free blog design template and tweak it.\\nWrite & publish your first post.\\nShare your thoughts with the world. The fun part!\\nPromote your blog.\\nGet more people to read your blog with the proper marketing.\\nMake money blogging.\\nChoose from several options to monetize your blog.\\nShould you start a blog?\\nOne of the misconceptions about starting a blog is that you need to be a great writer to be successful. Nothing could be further from the truth. People read blog sites to get a personal perspective on things, so most bloggers write in a very informal and conversational style.\\nAnd because of the format, many successful bloggers will\\nwrite about a variety of topics\\non the same blog.\\nIn addition, you don’t need to be an expert on any of the topics you write about to have a successful blog. For example, visitors to a cooking blog don’t want to read a textbook from a food scientist, they want to hear the experiences of someone who has actually cooked some real meals, mistakes and all.\\nTo be successful as a blogger there is really just one requirement: a passion for your topic.\\nAt its heart, blogging is about sharing your knowledge with the world. Writing about things that you are passionate about makes the process of starting a successful blog so much easier. As long as you are writing about things that you are genuinely interested in, your passion will shine through and keep your visitors interested.\\nSo why would you go to the trouble of blogging? There are a few reasons:\\nShare your story.\\nA blog allows you to have a voice and be heard. You can share your story with the entire world if you so choose. One of the most common ways blogs are used are as a diary where the blogger writes about their daily experiences so that friends, family, and others can all be a part of their lives.\\nMake money from home.\\nBlogging can be quite lucrative if done correctly. The top bloggers in the world obviously earn quite a bit, but even a part-time blogger can expect to make a nice profit if things are done correctly. The best part about it is that blogging is a form of passive income, since you can spend just a few hours a week writing a piece of content and then continue to profit from it long after the the writing is finished. I go into much more detail on how to blog for money later in this guide.\\nRecognition for yourself or your business.\\nNo, you probably won’t have paparazzi following you around because of your latest post. But a successful blog makes your idea into a reality, and can gain you a ton of recognition in your respective field. Many bloggers are known as experts just because of their blogs, and some have even gotten book and movie deals based on their blogs.\\nFind a community.\\nBlogging at its heart is interactive. You write a post and people comment on it. This is a good way to connect with people who are interested in the same things as you are. Blogging allows you to teach these people based on your experience, and it gives you the opportunity to learn from your readers as well.\\nReady to begin?\\nClick here to go to Step #1 of the guide\\nWhat is a blog anyway?\\nIn short,\\na blog is a type of website that focuses mainly on written content\\n, also known as blog posts. In popular culture we most often hear about news blogs or celebrity blog sites, but as you’ll see in this guide, you can start a successful blog on just about any topic imaginable.\\nBloggers often write from a personal perspective that allows them to connect directly with their readers. In addition, most blogs also have a “comments” section where visitors can correspond with the blogger. Interacting with your visitors in the comments section helps to further the connection between the blogger and the reader.\\nThis direct connection to the reader is one of the main benefits of starting a blog. This connection allows you to interact and share ideas with other like-minded people. It also allows you to build trust with your readers. Having the trust and loyalty of your readers also opens up the door to making money from your blog, which is something I discuss later in this guide.\\nThe good news is that the internet is exploding with growth right now. More people than ever are online. This explosion in growth means more potential readers for your blog. In short, if you are thinking about starting a blog then there is no better time than right now.\\nLet’s start your blog!\\nStep 1: Pick a blog name\\nIf you are not sure what to name your blog, or what topic to blog about, skip to the\\nnext section\\n.\\nIf you’ve already got an idea for the name of your blog, you can check to make sure that no one else has already registered it:\\nSee if your blog name is available:\\nNote: You cannot use any spaces or punctuation other than dashes in a domain name.\\nIf you find that the name you wanted is already taken there are a few things you can do:\\nTry a different domain extension.\\nIf the .com version is already registered you may still be able to get the .net or .org version of the name.\\nAdd small words.\\nWords like “a”, “my”, “best”, or “the”. For example, this site is called TheBlogStarter.com instead of BlogStarter.com.\\nAdd dashes between words.\\nFor example, scott-chow.com\\nHow to Choose a Blog Topic & Name\\nIf you don’t have an idea for a name already, the first step is choosing your blog topic.\\nIf you’re not sure what to blog about, there are\\na few ways to find a good blog topic\\n:\\nLife experiences.\\nEveryone has lessons they have learned through life experience. Sharing this knowledge can be incredibly helpful to others in similar situations.\\nFor example, I recently helped a woman start her blog about being a fireman’s wife. She has a lot of experience and knowledge to share with others about this topic, and it has helped her connect with others in similar situations.\\nThink about the things you have experienced in life. This could be related to your family (example: a blog about being a stay at home mom), work (a blog about experiences dealing with clients), or other life experiences (a blog about dealing with a troubling time such as a disease or divorce, or about a happy time such as preparing for a wedding or a birth of a child).\\nA personal blog.\\nA personal blog is a blog all about you. This will include a variety of topics, from things you do on a daily basis, to random thoughts and musings. This is a great way to share your thoughts with the world without having to stick to just one topic.\\nHobbies & passions.\\nHobbies or other interests you are passionate about are a great place to start. Cooking, travel, fashion, sports, and cars are all classic examples. But even blogs about more obscure hobbies can be successful, since the your audience is literally anyone in the world with the internet.\\nOnce you have a topic it’s time to choose your blog name, also known as your domain name.\\nA good blog name should be descriptive\\nso that potential visitors can instantly tell what your blog is about just from the name.\\nIf you are blogging about one specific topic then you will definitely want to include that in some way when you pick a domain name. Try not to get hung-up on just one word though. For example, a cooking blog doesn’t necessarily have to have the word “cooking” in it. The words “food”, “recipes”, and “meals” would also let people know that your blog is about cooking.\\nIf you are planning to create a personal blog where you discuss a variety of topics then I recommend using your name, or some variation of it, since your blog is all about you. For example, I own the blog scottchow.com. You can also add your middle name or middle initial if you find your name is already taken. Or you could use a variation like “Scott Chow Blog” or “Blogging with Scott”.\\nCan’t decide on a good name for your blog?\\nContact me\\nand I will help you personally (for free)!\\nOnce you have some name ideas you will need to\\nchoose a domain extension\\n.\\nA .com domain extension is the most preferred, but .net or .org work as well. It is also important to note that for the purposes of a blog domain you cannot have any spaces between words.\\nSo “Blogging with Scott” becomes bloggingwithscott.com\\nStep 2: Get your blog online\\nNow that you’ve got a name picked out it’s time to get your blog online. This might sound hard or technical, but the steps below will walk you right through and\\nmake the process easy\\n.\\nTo get your blog up and running you need two things: blog hosting (also known as web hosting) and blogging software. The good news is that these typically come packaged together.\\nA blog host is a company that stores all of the files for your blog and delivers them to the user when they type in your blog name.\\nYou must have a blog host in order to have a blog\\n.\\nYou also need to have the software to build your blog. In this guide I will be showing you how to build a blog using the WordPress blogging software, because it is the most popular, customizable, and easiest to use.\\nThe web host I recommend, and the one I show you how to use in this guide, is\\nBlueHost\\n. I personally use BlueHost and I recommend them for all new bloggers because:\\nThey will\\nregister your custom domain name for free\\n, making sure no one else can take it.\\nThey have a\\n30 day money back guarantee\\nif you are unsatisfied for any reason.\\nThey offer a free, automatic installation of the WordPress blogging software (which I show you how to use in this guide).\\nThey offer\\nreliable\\nweb hosting that has been recommended by WordPress since 2005 and they currently host over 2 million blogs and websites.\\nThey have helpful\\n24/7 customer service\\nvia phone or web chat.\\nUse any\\nBlueHost link\\non this site by January 1st to get the special New Year’s Sale price of $1.99 per month.\\nDisclosure:\\nBlueHost compensates The Blog Starter when you purchase through\\nthis link\\n, so my services are free of charge to you! In fact, if you have any trouble at all setting up a blog with this tutorial, just\\ncontact me\\nand I will do it for you (free!)\\n.\\n1.\\nClick here by January 1st to get the special New Year’s Sale price of $1.99 per month on BlueHost\\nand then click “get started now”.\\n2. Select your plan.\\nI recommend that beginning bloggers get the Basic plan.\\nClick “Select” to choose your plan.\\nAll of the BlueHost plans have everything you need to get your blog up and running, including a\\nfree custom domain name, easy WordPress installation, web hosting, and custom email addresses (yourname@yourdomain.com)\\n.\\n3. Type in your domain name in the box and then click “Search for Domain” to start the registration process.\\nWhen you register a domain name your contact information gets put into a database of domain name owners. If you would rather keep your information private, be sure to check the box at the top right that says “Add Private Registration”.\\nIf you already own a domain name and want to use it for your blog, check the box at the top left\\n4. Now you will also choose your hosting package options.\\nThe discounted price is automatically applied when you click any BlueHost link on this page.\\nI recommend deleting the “Professional Email” free trial.  You will still be able to create custom email addresses (yourname@yourblog.com) without this feature.\\n5. Fill out your billing details and create your account password on the registration page.\\n6. Login to the WordPress administrator dashboard\\nOnce you complete the checkout you will be automatically logged-in to your BlueHost account.\\xa0 You will then need to login to WordPress.\\nClick “Edit site”\\nto be taken to the WordPress administrator dashboard.\\nOn the following screen click “I’m following a tutorial, take me to the WP Admin Dashboard” to be logged-in.\\nHaving trouble installing your blog?\\nGet help here\\n.\\nStep 3: Customize your blog\\nHow do I start a blog? You can\\nwatch me build and customize a beautiful blog from scratch\\nhere:\\nThe video above should answer a lot of questions you might have about how to set up a blog and get it customized. Here is a step-by-step break-down of some of things I show in the video.\\nLogging in\\nIf you are not already logged-in from the previous step, go to\\nBluehost.com\\nand click “Login” on the top right to bring up the login screen.\\xa0 You can then login using your domain name and the password you set in the previous step.\\xa0 If you have misplaced your password you can reset it by clicking the “Forgot Password” link.\\nOnce you log-in you will be taken to your BlueHost Portal.\\xa0 From the portal you can click the blue “WordPress” button to be logged-in automatically to your WordPress blog.\\nChanging your blog design\\nOnce you login you will be in the WordPress dashboard. This is where you can make any changes you want to your blog.\\nEveryone has a different idea of how they want their blog to look. One of the great things about WordPress is that you can change your entire layout and design with just a few clicks.\\nIn WordPress, blog layouts are known as “Themes”. What is a blog theme? Themes control the entire design of your WordPress blog. To change your theme you are going to click on the “Appearance” tab on the left menu.\\nYou will see several free WordPress themes are already installed on your blog: Twenty Twenty-Four, Twenty Twenty-Five, etc. These are well-designed, clean-looking themes that can work for just about any type of blog. In fact, many of the world’s top bloggers use one of these themes.\\nUnless you have a very specific design in mind for your blog,\\nI suggest you use one of these themes to start with\\n. For our example, let’s use the “Twenty Twenty-Five” WordPress theme. In order to activate the theme on your blog, hover over the theme and click the “Activate” button. That’s it! You have changed the entire design of your blog with just one click!\\nIf you don’t like any of the themes that are already installed you can easily choose from thousands of other free WordPress themes. To install a new WordPress theme, click on the “Appearance” tab on the left menu and then click “Add New Theme”.\\nThis is the WordPress theme search screen.\\xa0 There are thousands of themes to choose from.\\xa0 You can change your entire design at anytime simply by activating a new WordPress theme.\\xa0 To find a theme you like, I suggest you click on the “Popular” tab and start browsing. When you find one that you like you can hover over it and then click the blue “Install” button.\\nOnce the theme is installed click “Activate” to activate the theme on your blog. To see your new theme in action, go to your blog and take a look!\\nChanging your theme is the simplest way to customize your WordPress blog, but there are lots of other customizations you can do. Check out my\\nfull post on customizing your WordPress blog for an in-depth step-by-step guide\\n.\\nYou can also watch the video above to see me completely customize a WordPress blog from scratch.\\nStep 4: How to write a new blog post & publish it\\nNow that your blog is up and running it’s time to actually do some blogging!\\xa0 Let’s create your first piece of content.\\nGo to the left menu and click on “Posts”.\\nYou will see there is already a post there. This is a default post on every new WordPress blog, and we don’t need it. To delete it click “Trash” just under the post.\\nTo begin writing a new post, click the “Add New Post” link.\\nYou are now on the post editor screen. Enter the title of your post in the top box and then begin writing your post in the lower box.\\nIf you would like to add a picture to your post, click on the + icon and click “Image”. Then click “Upload” to select a picture from your computer.\\nOnce you have finished your post just click the “Publish” button on the top right side of the screen to publish the new post.\\nContent That Should be on Your Blog\\nThere are two main types of content your blog should provide: static and dynamic content.\\nStatic Content:\\nYour blog should contain a few necessary pages explicitly designed to provide the visitor with the tools they need. The content on these pages is static, meaning – the content doesn’t change, or at least not very often. These are mainly top-level pages that can be accessed via a menu on your blog.\\nThese static content pages should be in place well before you launch your blog to the world.\\nImportant static pages to include:\\nAbout Me (Us)\\n– This page should include a biographical summary of the author(s) as well as a mission statement. Think about the answers to these questions:\\nHow did your passion for the subject matter develop?\\nWhat do you want to convey to the world?\\nWhat is your ultimate goal?\\nContact Me (Us)\\n– A contact page provides the visitor a place to reach the author which, in turn, provides the visitor with the reassurance that you are a real and reachable author. You can add your physical address, phone number, and custom email address. Or you can utilize a simple contact form to keep your personal identifying information private. You should put links to all of your social media profiles here as well.\\nAside from your blog, which is generally introduced on the home/main page, these two all-important pages should be visible on your top (header) menu and easy to access.\\xa0 You can take a look at the top of this page to see how I have these pages included in the header menu.\\nSee this detailed guide to customizing your blog menus\\nif you need help.\\nOther static pages that are equally as important but less commonly thought of are:\\nDisclaimer Page\\n: If you intend to monetize your blog, you must describe the ways you intend to generate income. This is an absolute must-have page that should not be overlooked, as per FTC guidelines. For example, if you are discussing and endorsing a product, and stand to profit by linking to the product, this relationship must be disclosed.\\nPrivacy Policy\\n: If you collect data from your visitors in any way, you are required to add a privacy policy page that tells visitors exactly how you are collecting data, how you are using it, and if you are sharing that data. If you implement\\nGoogle Adsense\\nor a\\nGoogle Analytics\\naccount on your blog, a Privacy Policy must be used. This page is required by the CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) and the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), and is included by default on your WordPress blog.\\nTerms of Service\\n: If your blog is also running a store or selling services, it is a good idea to have a Terms of Service page to lessen your potential liability.\\nThese required static pages are typically linked to in the footer menu of a blog. They should, at the very least, be visible and accessible from the home page.\\xa0 Again, look at the bottom of this page to see how this looks in practice.\\nThere are other static pages you can choose to include depending on what suits your blog and business. Common static page examples are an advertising page to solicit paid advertisements, a donations page, a resource page to direct visitors to your favorite links within your field, and a page for submitting ideas and content.\\nDynamic Content:\\nYour dynamic content is your blog and the most important content you have to offer. This is where you, as the creator, will infuse the blog with your brand of informative content that supplies your audience with knowledgeable tips, facts, opinions, and stories. This is how you engage your visitors and keep them coming back for more.\\nYour blog content should be regularly submitted at specific intervals. Waiting months to create content will never build a following. Posting content weekly and driving traffic to these posts will help build your brand.\\nHow to write great blog content\\nEach post should be lengthy, informative, and engaging. It’s not always easy to come up with new blog post ideas on a regular basis and you are free to mix up the tone and even the subject matter to keep things lively and interesting. It’s your space, after all. But there are a few elements that each and every piece of content should endeavor to include.\\nDefine the Content:\\nCreate an alluring post title that stimulates curiosity and encourages clicks. Use the first paragraph of your post to clearly define the topic of your article and provide a possible hook to keep the reader reading.\\nThe Longer the Better – But Break It Up\\n: The more information and detail you include, the better. But visitors will begin to skim if the content contains lengthy paragraphs a mile long, and will pop out faster than they came in. Visitors enjoy tidbits. Keep your paragraphs short with spaces in between, use lists and standout quotes, use images, and always include headings and sub-headings so that visitors can find what they’re looking for.\\nEngage The Reader:\\nAt the end of each post, a common tactic used to engage visitors is posing a meaningful question to your audience and asking them to reply in the comments. This simple measure can increase engagement tenfold.\\nOriginal Content:\\nYour content should always be original. Never plagiarize – you will eventually be called out on it and could even face consequences. Your content should come from your heart, your brain, your knowledge base, and your experience. You can get topic ideas from others in your field, but make sure the content comes from you.\\nOriginal Photos:\\nWhile it is easy to include stock images from free image sites, it is even better to include your own photos and graphic work. Another idea is to take free images and manipulate them with a free photo editor.\\nEdit Your Work:\\nYour blog content should be sufficiently edited. Nothing says unprofessional like several typographical and grammatical errors. If you need a few refresher courses in grammar, consider using a writing application.\\nPublishing Your Blog\\nEven after you have written a post your blog may still be showing a placeholder page.\\nWhen you are ready to make your blog public for the first time, just click “Home” at the top left of the menu in your WordPress dashboard, and then click “Launch with confidence”. Click the blue “Launch your site” button to remove the placeholder page and launch your blog.\\nCongratulations! You now know how to start your own blog and publish content!\\nStep 5: Promote your blog\\nCreating a well-designed blog and writing great content is just the start. In order to get visitors to your blog you will need spend some time promoting it, especially when you first start.\\nThe strategies below will help get your blog in front of more readers. You don’t need to use every strategy – try out a few and see what works well for you.\\nAlert Your Inner Circle\\nThe very first people who should become aware of your blog are your inner circle. This includes family, friends, and colleagues within your field. Encourage them to become followers, ask them to mention your new blog, and – most importantly – thank them.\\nUse Social Media\\nWhile you don’t want to overdo it, you still want to create accounts with the “biggies” like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest, and Instagram.\\xa0 You should post a link to your newest content on your accounts, but you can also post relevant news and links to other sources that your readers may find interesting.\\xa0 Don’t forget to use hashtags and engage with your followers!\\nOne of my favorite ways to get visitors to my blog is to post links on my social accounts, like Facebook and Twitter. This is great, because not only do your friends see the link, but if your friends share the link with their friends it automatically multiplies your visitors. If you have created high-quality content on your blog then social media is a way for your blog to go viral.\\nComment on Other Blogs\\nFind other blogs in your community and engage with them. Using the comment section, introduce yourself and leave engaging and constructive comments. Many will allow you to leave a link to your blog. After creating relationships with prominent bloggers in your community, you will find yourself within their ranks quickly.\\nEngage with Your Visitors\\nWhen your readers leave comments on your posts, always engage with them. Reply to their comments and questions, give them “likes” and affirmations. When it is obvious that the author cares about his/her community and readership, visitors are naturally encouraged to return.\\nCollaborate with other bloggers\\nBecome enmeshed in your blogging community by collaborating with respected members of your field. Collaborating includes guest posting, promoting each other’s blogs and products, and regularly interacting through comments and social media.\\nPost Regularly\\nPost content regularly. Create an editorial calendar and stick to it. A good blogger posts at least once per week to start. If you have long lapses between posts, your followers will drop off and your growth will be severely hampered. It’s not easy to post on a schedule, but it’s something you absolutely must stick to.\\nCreate an Email List\\nIn addition to getting new visitors to your blog, you will also want to make sure your current visitors are coming back. This is where email marketing plays a big role. By collecting the email addresses of your visitors (with their permission of course), you can then notify them when you post new content on your blog. This keeps people coming back to your blog, which not only gives you more readers over time, it also allows you to build a closer relationship with your visitors.\\nEmail marketing is too big a topic to cover well here, so I created a separate\\nguide to email marketing\\nfor those who are interested (hint: every blogger who wants more readers needs to read this guide).\\nOptimize your blog for search engines\\nYou want your blog to appear in search results as soon as possible.\\nGoogle:\\nSign up for a Google Webmaster account and open the\\nSearch Console\\n. To add your blog, click “Add Property” and follow the steps to add your blog.\\nBing:\\nSign up for a Bing Webmaster account and add your blog.\\nSubmitting your blog is the first step in process known as search engine optimization (SEO).\\nKeep in mind that with a brand new blog your traffic will be minimal to start with. However, this will change over time as long as you continue to add informative and relevant content on a regular basis.\\nTo optimize this process, each page of your blog should include these fundamental elements:\\nHeader Tags:\\nSection headings and subheadings should be wrapped in header tags.\\xa0 To do this, click on the left item of the block you are writing in and change it to “Heading”.\\xa0 You can then choose from H1, H2, H3, etc.\\nCategorization:\\nYour content should be clearly categorized into specific and relevant categories.\\xa0 In the post editor screen, click on “Document” on the right menu, and then go down to “Categories” and “Add New Category”.\\nPermalinks:\\nEach blog post “slug” is the end portion of the URL. You want to make sure each post has a defined slug and doesn’t end with an article number. You can easily change this in your WordPress dashboard by going to “Settings” -> “Permalinks”. Select the “Post Name” option and click “Save Changes”\\nThere are many more factors relating to consider, such as installing something like the\\nYoast WordPress plugin\\n, but these are the big ones that will help improve your search rankings sooner rather than later.\\nFor more tips on promoting your blog make sure to\\ncheck out my in-depth guide to blog promotion\\n.\\nStep 6: Make money from your blog\\nOnce you have put in the effort of creating great blog content and promoting your blog, making money from your blog is actually the easy part.\\nBlogs have the potential to be extremely lucrative, but don’t assume that you’re going to start making money in the first week, or even in the first month. It could take six months to a year to start seeing a steady stream of income. Blogging takes work and dedication, but once you develop a large enough audience, there are several methods you can employ to monetize your blog.\\nSell advertising space\\nOnce you have a popular blog, advertisers will be hounding you for the opportunity to advertise. The best way to take advantage of this situation is to use Google Adsense. Google finds the advertisers for you and all you have to do is place the Google Adsense code on your blog to start running ads. Google Adsense takes all of the hard work out of the process and just cuts you a check.\\nI go into the full details of\\nhow to set up Google Adsense for your WordPress blog here\\n.\\nSell affiliate products\\nAn affiliate program is a commission-based way to advertise. When one of your readers clicks on a link on your blog, they get sent to an advertiser’s site and you earn a commission if they purchase. Affiliate links are a nice way to earn income through the use of product reviews. However, you must remember to disclose that you are an affiliate for the product.\\nSell Products and Services\\nSelling your own products and services directly on your blog is a great way to increase your income. As your blog grows and you begin to see a wide audience, your products and services will begin to sell themselves.\\nUse the sidebar of your blog to increase the visibility of what you sell using visual images and a link to your storefront page.\\nSell digital downloads\\nEbooks, video tutorials, and e-courses are the most commonly consumed digital materials sold by bloggers. With little to no overhead and no shipping costs, you can keep the price low and inviting.\\nIf you are extremely knowledgeable in your field, an ebook can practically write itself. Give it a try, you might surprise yourself!\\nSell memberships\\nAnother way to monetize is by creating membership options on your blog. This allows you to offer members more exclusive content only available with a paid membership. For example, you could offer unlimited downloads of digital goods, free consultations, a private network or forum where community members can mix and mingle, and private content available to members only.\\nThere are many ways a blog can capitalize on popularity and traffic. Choosing the way you monetize from your blog depends on your goals and the purpose of your blog. Those who are selling services, physical goods, and digital goods, for example, may not want to participate in affiliate programs where traffic could be lost to another site.\\nFor more information see my\\nfull guide to making money blogging here\\nNeed more help?\\nI hope this guide has answered any questions you had on how to start your blog, but if any of the steps were unclear to you, you can\\nfind a more detailed version of each step\\nby using the menu at the top right of this page (or at the bottom of this page if you’re on a smartphone).\\nMore\\nspecific tutorials can be found on my blog page\\n.

It is your passion, your creativity, your knowledge and expertise, and what you bring to the community that makes a blog successful. As long as you provide content that is interesting, informative, and engaging to the readers you’re looking to connect with, your success is only limited by the number of posts you’re able to produce.\\nKeep writing, keep interacting, keep engaging, and your blog quickly become one of the success stories. As long as you’re passionate about the subject matter, the sky is the limit.\\nWhat do you need to start a blog?\\nTime, passion, and a clear goal.\\nBlogging is nearly a full-time operation. A successful blogger commits to posting lengthy and detailed content at least weekly. Promoting the blog must also be done regularly across social accounts and through peer interactions.\\nEqually important is the passion behind your blog. To come up with great content on a regular basis your blog should revolve around a topic that you are obsessed with. You don’t have to be the leading authority on the subject matter. You only need to possess passion, excitement, dedication, and deeply rooted opinions.\\nYou also need a clear goal in mind. What is the main objective of your blog? Is it to inform the public? To eventually retain paid subscribers? With a clear final objective you can grow a blog that satisfies these goals in the long term.\\nWhat should my blog be about?\\nAnswer these questions:\\nWhat are you passionate about? What do you think about daily? What topic do you annoy all of your friends, family, and co-workers with on a regular basis? What do you find yourself dreaming about? What do you find yourself constantly researching? What do you read about?\\nIf there is a common denominator in your answers to these questions – THAT is what your blog should be about.\\nYour blog should be about what interests you – what you’re passionate about. And once you begin to build your blog, no matter what the subject material, you will find a community of people who are interested in what you have to say.\\nHow do I find a profitable niche for my blog?\\nIf you know the general topic for your blog, a simple way of making your niche more profitable is by narrowing the niche to eliminate competition.\\nFor example, let’s say you’re passionate about food and you want to start by creating a recipe blog. You’ll be competing with a million recipe blogs. So let’s narrow that topic down to something that is more manageable yet still important to a lot of people. Making the topic of your blog more specific will help to eliminate a lot of competition and elevate your blog results in search engines for more specific queries.\\nHow do I name my blog?\\nThis can ultimately be a fun exercise.\\nAs an example, let’s say your blog will be about custom pet gift baskets. In this instance, let’s list all the main words this blog will be about.\\nNow let’s list some variant synonyms of these words. Use a thesaurus if need be!\\nNow list nouns and adjectives that apply to you as the creator.\\nNow start putting words together, introduce new words, and keep playing around until you come up with a name you like!\\nIf you are still struggling you can always try using a blog name generator for additional ideas.\\nWhat do you do if your domain name is taken?\\nIf the domain name you want is taken and the full web address is your trademarked business name, you can assert your trademark rights and privileges and eventually get this domain handed over to you. It is a lengthy process that will involve lawyers and hefty fees, but as long as the name is trademarked by you, you would likely win the domain name.\\nIf your name isn’t trademarked, don’t attempt to buy the .info or .biz variation of the domain. Instead, try a slight variation of the domain name such as adding a dash between words, or inserting the word “the” or other nominal words.\\nIn some cases, the domain is owned but isn’t being used. Trying searching for it in the browser. If the URL is pointed to a different domain, it isn’t being used, only redirected. You may be able to buy the domain for the right price from the current owner. If the domain is parked, you may also attempt to purchase the domain.\\nWhere is the best place to create a blog?\\nIn the tutorial on this page I show you how to create your blog using\\nBlueHost\\nand\\nWordPress.org\\n.\\xa0 This is known as a self-hosted WordPress blog, and it is what I personally use for this blog and it’s what I recommend to all my readers.\\xa0 When you sign-up with BlueHost you get a free domain name, they will automatically install WordPress (WordPress.org) on your BlueHost account. You can begin blogging as soon as your account is set up. You can easily customize your self-hosted WordPress blog just by following the steps in the tutorial on this page.\\nHow much does it cost to start a blog?\\nYou can make a blog for absolutely nothing. It doesn’t cost one red cent.\\nBut let’s be realistic. If you want your blog to be taken seriously, you can’t just get a subdomain from one of the free blogging sites like Blogspot. You’ll want to pick a custom domain name and register it instead. Domain names cost around $15 per year, on average. So now you’re a whopping $15 in the hole.\\nBut the best way to start your blog is through one of the many web hosting companies. The best web hosting choice is a WordPress hosting account through\\nBluehost\\nwhich is $1.99 per month and includes free domain name registration, so your total cost for 1 year is just $33.\\nThese are your main costs associated with starting a successful blog. Of course, you may incur other costs with additional services such as email marketing. As with any business, the biggest expenditure is often advertising, but this would be a cost incurred later on down the road if you choose to go that route.\\nDo bloggers make money?\\nBloggers have the ability to make a full-time income from blogging alone. Some bloggers make hundreds of thousands of dollars. While it isn’t easy to become a highly paid blogger, it is quite possible. As with any business, it takes a lot of hard work and plenty of time.\\nMany bloggers give up on their project after just a few months. They become discouraged when the money doesn’t come in right away, and it almost never does without an instant and immediate following that comes from being a high profile persona. Therefore, time and patience are needed to reach “influencer” status. Those who make money online are the ones who stick with it.\\nThere are several ways a blogger can earn money:\\nAdvertisements\\n:\\nAs your blog gains traction and brings in a healthy amount of daily visitors, advertisers may pay good money for a well-placed ad on your blog.\\nContextual Ads:\\nWith Google Adsense a small piece of code can be placed on your blog that dynamically shows ads related to your content. When one of your readers clicks on an ad the advertiser pays Google, and Google sends you a percentage.\\nAffiliate Programs:\\nAffiliate ads are a very popular way to monetize a blog. These ads lead visitors to a product or service on another website. If a sale resulting from a click on your blog is made, you get a commission, and some commissions can be very high. Affiliate programs can be found on individual stores, or on large-scale platforms such as Amazon.\\nSponsored Posts:\\nAdvertisers can pay a smaller fee to sponsor individual posts rather than advertising on the entire blog. This is a great method for making money on fledgling blogs.\\nHow do bloggers get paid?\\nBloggers are most commonly paid by advertisers. How the blogger is paid varies depending on what type of ads are used.\\nCPC:\\nCPC or “Cost Per Click” ads generate revenue simply through clicks. CPC ads are generally highly targeted and rotational. Ads appear on specific blog posts and are related to the content of that post. The number of clicks you generate, which trends upward as your traffic increases, will ultimately determine the amount you are paid.\\nFlat Fee:\\nIf a blog’s traffic is high, advertisers may pay a monthly flat fee for ad space on the blog’s website. That ad space could appear all over the website, within a section, or just a few pages. The money comes directly from the advertiser.\\nCommission\\n:\\nAds from an affiliate network use affiliate links. These links track visitors that come from your blog to the advertiser’s site. If a purchase is made by a visitor who originated from your blog, you receive a commission.\\nShould I start my blog on WordPress?\\nIf you’re new to blogging and you don’t have much experience with HTML or coding, then yes – self-hosting a WordPress blog is the best choice for you!\\nWhen it comes time to choose a blogging platform, the pros turn to WordPress.\\xa0 And even though WordPress is used by millions of smaller blogs, it also powers many of the biggest sites on the internet.\\xa0 In fact, WordPress is the most popular CMS (Content Management System) in the world with over 75 million blogs and websites currently using it. And there are many reasons why:\\nEasy to Use\\n:\\nWordPress is remarkably easy to use. Theme customizers help to easily design your blog, change colors, and add images. Once your design is complete, all you need to do is write your content. The internal blog editor records your posts and displays them for you.\\nBlog Anywhere\\n: As long as you have Internet access, you can edit your WordPress blog and write new posts. WordPress provides you with an administrative backend where you may log in and work on your blog from anywhere in the world using a PC, Mac, tablet, or smartphone.\\nYou Don’t Need To Know How to Code\\n:\\nWordPress gives you easy tools to set up a blog that looks stunning without knowing a single line of HTML code or hiring a web developer. This makes WordPress a great option for those who don’t want to deal with technical issues.\\nBuilt-in SEO\\n: Google favors blogs built with WordPress. The out-of-the-box SEO (Search Engine Optimization) which comes packed with WordPress delivers impressive results over time in search engines. This translates to more readers for your blog.\\nFree Themes\\n: The WordPress CMS is connected to a repository where thousands of free themes (blog layouts) are available to browse and upload. Directly from the backend of your blog you can browse a multitude of themes with varying styles and functionality. These free WordPress themes can be installed with one click, and then easily customized by a total beginner.\\nIs WordPress free?\\nYes! A self-hosted WordPress blog is a open-source, which is completely free. And there are two different WordPress options, both free, but\\nCOMPLETELY\\ndifferent, which you should be aware of.\\xa0 Choosing between them is one of the most crucial decisions you will make.\\nWordPress.org\\n: This option is completely, 100% free.\\xa0 WordPress.org is the blog platform I show you how to use in the tutorial on this page.\\xa0 While it is completely free to download, it doesn’t run on its own. You will need a web host (see the\\nstep-by-step guide\\n) and you’ll also need to buy a new domain name. Because you need your own web hosting plan, this option is known as a self-hosted WordPress blog. So while WordPress is technically free, there are fees involved with getting your new self-hosted WordPress blog up and running (less than $3 per month).\\nWordPress.com\\n: WordPress.com is a different platform that lets the user create a free blog on a subdomain of WordPress.com. While it does technically let you blog for free, if you would like to enable some basic options, or have your own domain, you will have to upgrade your account to a paid plan.\\xa0 For this and other reasons, I don’t recommend WordPress.com.\\nHow often should I blog?\\nIf your goal is to eventually make money from your blog, you’ll want to start blogging as often as possible – at least once per week. Blogging can be casual if your goal is solely for personal pleasure. But if you’re seeking a large audience and wish to become a leader in your field, blogging weekly is a must.\\nWhile frequency is important, it should not come at the expense of quality.\\xa0 Not every piece of content needs be 2,000 words, but all of your posts should be informative and of value to your audience. This is no easy feat. However, if you’re able to stick with blogging on a regular schedule, it will become easier! As with anything else, the more you do it – the more skilled at it you become.\\nBlogging weekly also helps improve your traffic from search engines, which you can track in your Google Analytics account. When you first begin blogging your latest posts will take time to show up on search engines. As you continue to post regularly you will naturally have more blog posts showing up in the search results, which means more traffic to your blog.\\nWhy do blogs fail?\\nAlmost any blog has the potential to become a success, yet most blogs fail. And there are many reasons why. Here are the most common reasons why a blog fails:\\nGiving Up Too Fast\\n– The most common reason why a blog fails is simply that the content creator gives up before his or her blog even has a chance to become recognized. Before you begin a blog, you should realize that most blogs take months and even years to gain traction. It’s quite an investment. If you fail to gain visitors or make money within a month don’t stop!\\xa0 Continue to focus on creating quality content and getting your name out there via social media and networking.\\nIntermittent Blogging\\n– When there are long “silent periods” between posts it is difficult to build a solid following. People looking for information on your topic usually want a steady stream of new information to keep them interested. When a blog fails to deliver fresh and updated content people get bored and look elsewhere.\\nPoor Content\\n– Some bloggers think they can beat the system with auto-generated content or with duplicate content that is reworded. Readers know fluff when they read it. They know when an article has absolutely no value or when it is simply clickbait. A blog with poor content will never be successful.\\nToo Many Ads\\n– Blogs with dozens of ads obscuring most of the content will deter visitors from returning. People don’t come to your blog to be visually harassed by ill-placed, blinking advertisements. They come for information. While ads a good option to monetize, don’t overdo it.\\nMackenzie\\nsays:\\nAugust 26, 2024 at 5:19 pm\\nHello Scott,\\nThank you so much for this informational and easy to follow blog.

WordPress provides a Privacy Policy generator by default, so it is very easy to add when starting your blog. Beyond that, just make sure you are being transparent with your visitors if you are collecting any information about them.\\nYou may have specific legal issues depending on the topic you are writing about, but for most people just adding a privacy policy page is enough.\\nReply\\nSam\\nsays:\\nNovember 13, 2020 at 8:55 am\\nThis is wonderful! thank you so much for your helpful advice!

Yours truly, Yves Gagnon\\nReply\\nScott Chow\\nsays:\\nNovember 28, 2020 at 11:50 am\\nHi Yves,\\nDomain registration applies worldwide.  For example, the domain name for this site (theblogstarter.com) is registered to me and can’t be used by anyone else.  No matter where you are in the world, when you go to theblogstarter.com this is the site that comes up.  I hope that answers your question.\\nReply\\nFinn\\nsays:\\nOctober 15, 2020 at 5:06 am\\nThank you so much for your blog.

Just log-in to the WordPress dashboard of your account and then go “Users” on the left sidebar menu.  From here you can add new users.  You can also give each user different permissions if you so choose. For example, you could be the only administrator of the blog, while still giving other users the permission to write new content.\\nReply\\nHeidi\\nsays:\\nOctober 11, 2020 at 6:09 pm\\nHi Scott, can you use the wordpress from your laptop, tablet and phone to write on-the-go?\\nReply\\nScott Chow\\nsays:\\nNovember 28, 2020 at 12:00 pm\\nYes, you can easily blog from any internet-connected device.

From the WordPress dashboard, go to “Tools” on the left sidebar menu and then click on “Prviacy”.  This will take you to the privacy page generator and help you add it to your blog.\\nReply\\nVince\\nsays:\\nOctober 9, 2020 at 2:57 am\\nVery easy indeed. Thanks Scott.

After you have built up a solid readership then you can decrease the posting frequency.  Some really popular blogs only post every couple of months.\\nWhen you first start a blog I recommend launching it as soon as you finish your first post.

Most people just start with it as a side hustle, and then as it grows you can consider setting up a business. It would be best to talk to a tax accountant once you get to that point though.\\nReply\\nJeff M\\nsays:\\nSeptember 18, 2020 at 8:54 pm\\nHey Scott. I really appreciate the info, however, both you and BlueHost advertise the cost as “monthly.” When I went to sign up, it gave me a total cost which was the total cost for the contract. Before I give my payment information, I’d like to clarify if I’m paying monthly for the service, or if I have to pay a lump sum. Thanks.\\nReply\\nScott Chow\\nsays:\\nNovember 28, 2020 at 1:53 pm\\nHi Jeff,\\nYes, you will pay up front for the full length of your plan.  So if you do a 12 month plan then you pay for 12 months up front.  You can cancel at anytime and get a pro-rated refund for the unused months on your plan.\\nReply\\nMs. Williams\\nsays:\\nSeptember 17, 2020 at 10:25 pm\\nThank you for all of this information.

You have full control over the comments on your blog. For example, you can have comments automatically approved, or you can choose to manually approve only those that you want.

I will walk you through each and every step, using plenty of pictures and videos to make it all perfectly clear.\\nIf you get stuck or have questions at any point, simply\\nsend me a message\\nand I will do my best to help you out.\\nReady to start?\\nClick here to skip the intro and start building your blog now\\nMy name is Scott Chow, and I am going to show you how to start blogging today. I have been building blogs and websites since 2002. In that time I have launched several of my own blogs, and helped hundreds of others do the same.\\nI know that starting a blog can seem overwhelming and intimidating.\\nThis free guide is all about blogging for beginners\\n, and will teach you how to become a blogger with just the most basic computer skills. So whether you’re 8 or 88, you can create your own blog in 20 minutes.\\nI am not ashamed to admit that when I was first learning how to build a blog I made a ton of mistakes. You can benefit from more than a decade of my experience so that you don’t repeat these same mistakes when you make your own blog. I created this free guide so that a complete beginner can learn how to blog quickly and easily.\\nSo, just\\nhow do you start a blog?\\nLearn how to create a blog in about 20 minutes following these steps:\\nHow to Start a Blog in 6 Steps\\nPick a blog name.\\nChoose a descriptive name for your blog.\\nGet your blog online.\\nRegister your blog and get hosting.\\nCustomize your blog.\\nChoose a free blog design template and tweak it.\\nWrite & publish your first post.\\nShare your thoughts with the world. The fun part!\\nPromote your blog.\\nGet more people to read your blog with the proper marketing.\\nMake money blogging.\\nChoose from several options to monetize your blog.\\nShould you start a blog?\\nOne of the misconceptions about starting a blog is that you need to be a great writer to be successful. Nothing could be further from the truth. People read blog sites to get a personal perspective on things, so most bloggers write in a very informal and conversational style.\\nAnd because of the format, many successful bloggers will\\nwrite about a variety of topics\\non the same blog.\\nIn addition, you don’t need to be an expert on any of the topics you write about to have a successful blog. For example, visitors to a cooking blog don’t want to read a textbook from a food scientist, they want to hear the experiences of someone who has actually cooked some real meals, mistakes and all.\\nTo be successful as a blogger there is really just one requirement: a passion for your topic.\\nAt its heart, blogging is about sharing your knowledge with the world. Writing about things that you are passionate about makes the process of starting a successful blog so much easier. As long as you are writing about things that you are genuinely interested in, your passion will shine through and keep your visitors interested.\\nSo why would you go to the trouble of blogging? There are a few reasons:\\nShare your story.\\nA blog allows you to have a voice and be heard. You can share your story with the entire world if you so choose. One of the most common ways blogs are used are as a diary where the blogger writes about their daily experiences so that friends, family, and others can all be a part of their lives.\\nMake money from home.\\nBlogging can be quite lucrative if done correctly. The top bloggers in the world obviously earn quite a bit, but even a part-time blogger can expect to make a nice profit if things are done correctly. The best part about it is that blogging is a form of passive income, since you can spend just a few hours a week writing a piece of content and then continue to profit from it long after the the writing is finished. I go into much more detail on how to blog for money later in this guide.\\nRecognition for yourself or your business.\\nNo, you probably won’t have paparazzi following you around because of your latest post. But a successful blog makes your idea into a reality, and can gain you a ton of recognition in your respective field. Many bloggers are known as experts just because of their blogs, and some have even gotten book and movie deals based on their blogs.\\nFind a community.\\nBlogging at its heart is interactive. You write a post and people comment on it. This is a good way to connect with people who are interested in the same things as you are. Blogging allows you to teach these people based on your experience, and it gives you the opportunity to learn from your readers as well.\\nReady to begin?\\nClick here to go to Step #1 of the guide\\nWhat is a blog anyway?\\nIn short,\\na blog is a type of website that focuses mainly on written content\\n, also known as blog posts. In popular culture we most often hear about news blogs or celebrity blog sites, but as you’ll see in this guide, you can start a successful blog on just about any topic imaginable.\\nBloggers often write from a personal perspective that allows them to connect directly with their readers. In addition, most blogs also have a “comments” section where visitors can correspond with the blogger. Interacting with your visitors in the comments section helps to further the connection between the blogger and the reader.\\nThis direct connection to the reader is one of the main benefits of starting a blog. This connection allows you to interact and share ideas with other like-minded people. It also allows you to build trust with your readers. Having the trust and loyalty of your readers also opens up the door to making money from your blog, which is something I discuss later in this guide.\\nThe good news is that the internet is exploding with growth right now. More people than ever are online. This explosion in growth means more potential readers for your blog. In short, if you are thinking about starting a blog then there is no better time than right now.\\nLet’s start your blog!\\nStep 1: Pick a blog name\\nIf you are not sure what to name your blog, or what topic to blog about, skip to the\\nnext section\\n.\\nIf you’ve already got an idea for the name of your blog, you can check to make sure that no one else has already registered it:\\nSee if your blog name is available:\\nNote: You cannot use any spaces or punctuation other than dashes in a domain name.\\nIf you find that the name you wanted is already taken there are a few things you can do:\\nTry a different domain extension.\\nIf the .com version is already registered you may still be able to get the .net or .org version of the name.\\nAdd small words.\\nWords like “a”, “my”, “best”, or “the”. For example, this site is called TheBlogStarter.com instead of BlogStarter.com.\\nAdd dashes between words.\\nFor example, scott-chow.com\\nHow to Choose a Blog Topic & Name\\nIf you don’t have an idea for a name already, the first step is choosing your blog topic.\\nIf you’re not sure what to blog about, there are\\na few ways to find a good blog topic\\n:\\nLife experiences.\\nEveryone has lessons they have learned through life experience. Sharing this knowledge can be incredibly helpful to others in similar situations.\\nFor example, I recently helped a woman start her blog about being a fireman’s wife. She has a lot of experience and knowledge to share with others about this topic, and it has helped her connect with others in similar situations.\\nThink about the things you have experienced in life. This could be related to your family (example: a blog about being a stay at home mom), work (a blog about experiences dealing with clients), or other life experiences (a blog about dealing with a troubling time such as a disease or divorce, or about a happy time such as preparing for a wedding or a birth of a child).\\nA personal blog.\\nA personal blog is a blog all about you. This will include a variety of topics, from things you do on a daily basis, to random thoughts and musings. This is a great way to share your thoughts with the world without having to stick to just one topic.\\nHobbies & passions.\\nHobbies or other interests you are passionate about are a great place to start. Cooking, travel, fashion, sports, and cars are all classic examples. But even blogs about more obscure hobbies can be successful, since the your audience is literally anyone in the world with the internet.\\nOnce you have a topic it’s time to choose your blog name, also known as your domain name.\\nA good blog name should be descriptive\\nso that potential visitors can instantly tell what your blog is about just from the name.\\nIf you are blogging about one specific topic then you will definitely want to include that in some way when you pick a domain name. Try not to get hung-up on just one word though. For example, a cooking blog doesn’t necessarily have to have the word “cooking” in it. The words “food”, “recipes”, and “meals” would also let people know that your blog is about cooking.\\nIf you are planning to create a personal blog where you discuss a variety of topics then I recommend using your name, or some variation of it, since your blog is all about you. For example, I own the blog scottchow.com. You can also add your middle name or middle initial if you find your name is already taken. Or you could use a variation like “Scott Chow Blog” or “Blogging with Scott”.\\nCan’t decide on a good name for your blog?\\nContact me\\nand I will help you personally (for free)!\\nOnce you have some name ideas you will need to\\nchoose a domain extension\\n.\\nA .com domain extension is the most preferred, but .net or .org work as well. It is also important to note that for the purposes of a blog domain you cannot have any spaces between words.\\nSo “Blogging with Scott” becomes bloggingwithscott.com\\nStep 2: Get your blog online\\nNow that you’ve got a name picked out it’s time to get your blog online. This might sound hard or technical, but the steps below will walk you right through and\\nmake the process easy\\n.\\nTo get your blog up and running you need two things: blog hosting (also known as web hosting) and blogging software. The good news is that these typically come packaged together.\\nA blog host is a company that stores all of the files for your blog and delivers them to the user when they type in your blog name.\\nYou must have a blog host in order to have a blog\\n.\\nYou also need to have the software to build your blog. In this guide I will be showing you how to build a blog using the WordPress blogging software, because it is the most popular, customizable, and easiest to use.\\nThe web host I recommend, and the one I show you how to use in this guide, is\\nBlueHost\\n. I personally use BlueHost and I recommend them for all new bloggers because:\\nThey will\\nregister your custom domain name for free\\n, making sure no one else can take it.\\nThey have a\\n30 day money back guarantee\\nif you are unsatisfied for any reason.\\nThey offer a free, automatic installation of the WordPress blogging software (which I show you how to use in this guide).\\nThey offer\\nreliable\\nweb hosting that has been recommended by WordPress since 2005 and they currently host over 2 million blogs and websites.\\nThey have helpful\\n24/7 customer service\\nvia phone or web chat.\\nUse any\\nBlueHost link\\non this site by January 1st to get the special New Year’s Sale price of $1.99 per month.\\nDisclosure:\\nBlueHost compensates The Blog Starter when you purchase through\\nthis link\\n, so my services are free of charge to you! In fact, if you have any trouble at all setting up a blog with this tutorial, just\\ncontact me\\nand I will do it for you (free!)\\n.\\n1.\\nClick here by January 1st to get the special New Year’s Sale price of $1.99 per month on BlueHost\\nand then click “get started now”.\\n2. Select your plan.\\nI recommend that beginning bloggers get the Basic plan.\\nClick “Select” to choose your plan.\\nAll of the BlueHost plans have everything you need to get your blog up and running, including a\\nfree custom domain name, easy WordPress installation, web hosting, and custom email addresses (yourname@yourdomain.com)\\n.\\n3. Type in your domain name in the box and then click “Search for Domain” to start the registration process.\\nWhen you register a domain name your contact information gets put into a database of domain name owners. If you would rather keep your information private, be sure to check the box at the top right that says “Add Private Registration”.\\nIf you already own a domain name and want to use it for your blog, check the box at the top left\\n4. Now you will also choose your hosting package options.\\nThe discounted price is automatically applied when you click any BlueHost link on this page.\\nI recommend deleting the “Professional Email” free trial.  You will still be able to create custom email addresses (yourname@yourblog.com) without this feature.\\n5. Fill out your billing details and create your account password on the registration page.\\n6. Login to the WordPress administrator dashboard\\nOnce you complete the checkout you will be automatically logged-in to your BlueHost account.\\xa0 You will then need to login to WordPress.\\nClick “Edit site”\\nto be taken to the WordPress administrator dashboard.\\nOn the following screen click “I’m following a tutorial, take me to the WP Admin Dashboard” to be logged-in.\\nHaving trouble installing your blog?\\nGet help here\\n.\\nStep 3: Customize your blog\\nHow do I start a blog? You can\\nwatch me build and customize a beautiful blog from scratch\\nhere:\\nThe video above should answer a lot of questions you might have about how to set up a blog and get it customized. Here is a step-by-step break-down of some of things I show in the video.\\nLogging in\\nIf you are not already logged-in from the previous step, go to\\nBluehost.com\\nand click “Login” on the top right to bring up the login screen.\\xa0 You can then login using your domain name and the password you set in the previous step.\\xa0 If you have misplaced your password you can reset it by clicking the “Forgot Password” link.\\nOnce you log-in you will be taken to your BlueHost Portal.\\xa0 From the portal you can click the blue “WordPress” button to be logged-in automatically to your WordPress blog.\\nChanging your blog design\\nOnce you login you will be in the WordPress dashboard. This is where you can make any changes you want to your blog.\\nEveryone has a different idea of how they want their blog to look. One of the great things about WordPress is that you can change your entire layout and design with just a few clicks.\\nIn WordPress, blog layouts are known as “Themes”. What is a blog theme? Themes control the entire design of your WordPress blog. To change your theme you are going to click on the “Appearance” tab on the left menu.\\nYou will see several free WordPress themes are already installed on your blog: Twenty Twenty-Four, Twenty Twenty-Five, etc. These are well-designed, clean-looking themes that can work for just about any type of blog. In fact, many of the world’s top bloggers use one of these themes.\\nUnless you have a very specific design in mind for your blog,\\nI suggest you use one of these themes to start with\\n. For our example, let’s use the “Twenty Twenty-Five” WordPress theme. In order to activate the theme on your blog, hover over the theme and click the “Activate” button. That’s it! You have changed the entire design of your blog with just one click!\\nIf you don’t like any of the themes that are already installed you can easily choose from thousands of other free WordPress themes. To install a new WordPress theme, click on the “Appearance” tab on the left menu and then click “Add New Theme”.\\nThis is the WordPress theme search screen.\\xa0 There are thousands of themes to choose from.\\xa0 You can change your entire design at anytime simply by activating a new WordPress theme.\\xa0 To find a theme you like, I suggest you click on the “Popular” tab and start browsing. When you find one that you like you can hover over it and then click the blue “Install” button.\\nOnce the theme is installed click “Activate” to activate the theme on your blog. To see your new theme in action, go to your blog and take a look!\\nChanging your theme is the simplest way to customize your WordPress blog, but there are lots of other customizations you can do. Check out my\\nfull post on customizing your WordPress blog for an in-depth step-by-step guide\\n.\\nYou can also watch the video above to see me completely customize a WordPress blog from scratch.\\nStep 4: How to write a new blog post & publish it\\nNow that your blog is up and running it’s time to actually do some blogging!\\xa0 Let’s create your first piece of content.\\nGo to the left menu and click on “Posts”.\\nYou will see there is already a post there. This is a default post on every new WordPress blog, and we don’t need it. To delete it click “Trash” just under the post.\\nTo begin writing a new post, click the “Add New Post” link.\\nYou are now on the post editor screen. Enter the title of your post in the top box and then begin writing your post in the lower box.\\nIf you would like to add a picture to your post, click on the + icon and click “Image”. Then click “Upload” to select a picture from your computer.\\nOnce you have finished your post just click the “Publish” button on the top right side of the screen to publish the new post.\\nContent That Should be on Your Blog\\nThere are two main types of content your blog should provide: static and dynamic content.\\nStatic Content:\\nYour blog should contain a few necessary pages explicitly designed to provide the visitor with the tools they need. The content on these pages is static, meaning – the content doesn’t change, or at least not very often. These are mainly top-level pages that can be accessed via a menu on your blog.\\nThese static content pages should be in place well before you launch your blog to the world.\\nImportant static pages to include:\\nAbout Me (Us)\\n– This page should include a biographical summary of the author(s) as well as a mission statement. Think about the answers to these questions:\\nHow did your passion for the subject matter develop?\\nWhat do you want to convey to the world?\\nWhat is your ultimate goal?\\nContact Me (Us)\\n– A contact page provides the visitor a place to reach the author which, in turn, provides the visitor with the reassurance that you are a real and reachable author. You can add your physical address, phone number, and custom email address. Or you can utilize a simple contact form to keep your personal identifying information private. You should put links to all of your social media profiles here as well.\\nAside from your blog, which is generally introduced on the home/main page, these two all-important pages should be visible on your top (header) menu and easy to access.\\xa0 You can take a look at the top of this page to see how I have these pages included in the header menu.\\nSee this detailed guide to customizing your blog menus\\nif you need help.\\nOther static pages that are equally as important but less commonly thought of are:\\nDisclaimer Page\\n: If you intend to monetize your blog, you must describe the ways you intend to generate income. This is an absolute must-have page that should not be overlooked, as per FTC guidelines. For example, if you are discussing and endorsing a product, and stand to profit by linking to the product, this relationship must be disclosed.\\nPrivacy Policy\\n: If you collect data from your visitors in any way, you are required to add a privacy policy page that tells visitors exactly how you are collecting data, how you are using it, and if you are sharing that data. If you implement\\nGoogle Adsense\\nor a\\nGoogle Analytics\\naccount on your blog, a Privacy Policy must be used. This page is required by the CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) and the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), and is included by default on your WordPress blog.\\nTerms of Service\\n: If your blog is also running a store or selling services, it is a good idea to have a Terms of Service page to lessen your potential liability.\\nThese required static pages are typically linked to in the footer menu of a blog. They should, at the very least, be visible and accessible from the home page.\\xa0 Again, look at the bottom of this page to see how this looks in practice.\\nThere are other static pages you can choose to include depending on what suits your blog and business. Common static page examples are an advertising page to solicit paid advertisements, a donations page, a resource page to direct visitors to your favorite links within your field, and a page for submitting ideas and content.\\nDynamic Content:\\nYour dynamic content is your blog and the most important content you have to offer. This is where you, as the creator, will infuse the blog with your brand of informative content that supplies your audience with knowledgeable tips, facts, opinions, and stories. This is how you engage your visitors and keep them coming back for more.\\nYour blog content should be regularly submitted at specific intervals. Waiting months to create content will never build a following. Posting content weekly and driving traffic to these posts will help build your brand.\\nHow to write great blog content\\nEach post should be lengthy, informative, and engaging. It’s not always easy to come up with new blog post ideas on a regular basis and you are free to mix up the tone and even the subject matter to keep things lively and interesting. It’s your space, after all. But there are a few elements that each and every piece of content should endeavor to include.\\nDefine the Content:\\nCreate an alluring post title that stimulates curiosity and encourages clicks. Use the first paragraph of your post to clearly define the topic of your article and provide a possible hook to keep the reader reading.\\nThe Longer the Better – But Break It Up\\n: The more information and detail you include, the better. But visitors will begin to skim if the content contains lengthy paragraphs a mile long, and will pop out faster than they came in. Visitors enjoy tidbits. Keep your paragraphs short with spaces in between, use lists and standout quotes, use images, and always include headings and sub-headings so that visitors can find what they’re looking for.\\nEngage The Reader:\\nAt the end of each post, a common tactic used to engage visitors is posing a meaningful question to your audience and asking them to reply in the comments. This simple measure can increase engagement tenfold.\\nOriginal Content:\\nYour content should always be original. Never plagiarize – you will eventually be called out on it and could even face consequences. Your content should come from your heart, your brain, your knowledge base, and your experience. You can get topic ideas from others in your field, but make sure the content comes from you.\\nOriginal Photos:\\nWhile it is easy to include stock images from free image sites, it is even better to include your own photos and graphic work. Another idea is to take free images and manipulate them with a free photo editor.\\nEdit Your Work:\\nYour blog content should be sufficiently edited. Nothing says unprofessional like several typographical and grammatical errors. If you need a few refresher courses in grammar, consider using a writing application.\\nPublishing Your Blog\\nEven after you have written a post your blog may still be showing a placeholder page.\\nWhen you are ready to make your blog public for the first time, just click “Home” at the top left of the menu in your WordPress dashboard, and then click “Launch with confidence”. Click the blue “Launch your site” button to remove the placeholder page and launch your blog.\\nCongratulations! You now know how to start your own blog and publish content!\\nStep 5: Promote your blog\\nCreating a well-designed blog and writing great content is just the start. In order to get visitors to your blog you will need spend some time promoting it, especially when you first start.\\nThe strategies below will help get your blog in front of more readers. You don’t need to use every strategy – try out a few and see what works well for you.\\nAlert Your Inner Circle\\nThe very first people who should become aware of your blog are your inner circle. This includes family, friends, and colleagues within your field. Encourage them to become followers, ask them to mention your new blog, and – most importantly – thank them.\\nUse Social Media\\nWhile you don’t want to overdo it, you still want to create accounts with the “biggies” like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest, and Instagram.\\xa0 You should post a link to your newest content on your accounts, but you can also post relevant news and links to other sources that your readers may find interesting.\\xa0 Don’t forget to use hashtags and engage with your followers!\\nOne of my favorite ways to get visitors to my blog is to post links on my social accounts, like Facebook and Twitter. This is great, because not only do your friends see the link, but if your friends share the link with their friends it automatically multiplies your visitors. If you have created high-quality content on your blog then social media is a way for your blog to go viral.\\nComment on Other Blogs\\nFind other blogs in your community and engage with them. Using the comment section, introduce yourself and leave engaging and constructive comments. Many will allow you to leave a link to your blog. After creating relationships with prominent bloggers in your community, you will find yourself within their ranks quickly.\\nEngage with Your Visitors\\nWhen your readers leave comments on your posts, always engage with them. Reply to their comments and questions, give them “likes” and affirmations. When it is obvious that the author cares about his/her community and readership, visitors are naturally encouraged to return.\\nCollaborate with other bloggers\\nBecome enmeshed in your blogging community by collaborating with respected members of your field. Collaborating includes guest posting, promoting each other’s blogs and products, and regularly interacting through comments and social media.\\nPost Regularly\\nPost content regularly. Create an editorial calendar and stick to it. A good blogger posts at least once per week to start. If you have long lapses between posts, your followers will drop off and your growth will be severely hampered. It’s not easy to post on a schedule, but it’s something you absolutely must stick to.\\nCreate an Email List\\nIn addition to getting new visitors to your blog, you will also want to make sure your current visitors are coming back. This is where email marketing plays a big role. By collecting the email addresses of your visitors (with their permission of course), you can then notify them when you post new content on your blog. This keeps people coming back to your blog, which not only gives you more readers over time, it also allows you to build a closer relationship with your visitors.\\nEmail marketing is too big a topic to cover well here, so I created a separate\\nguide to email marketing\\nfor those who are interested (hint: every blogger who wants more readers needs to read this guide).\\nOptimize your blog for search engines\\nYou want your blog to appear in search results as soon as possible.\\nGoogle:\\nSign up for a Google Webmaster account and open the\\nSearch Console\\n. To add your blog, click “Add Property” and follow the steps to add your blog.\\nBing:\\nSign up for a Bing Webmaster account and add your blog.\\nSubmitting your blog is the first step in process known as search engine optimization (SEO).\\nKeep in mind that with a brand new blog your traffic will be minimal to start with. However, this will change over time as long as you continue to add informative and relevant content on a regular basis.\\nTo optimize this process, each page of your blog should include these fundamental elements:\\nHeader Tags:\\nSection headings and subheadings should be wrapped in header tags.\\xa0 To do this, click on the left item of the block you are writing in and change it to “Heading”.\\xa0 You can then choose from H1, H2, H3, etc.\\nCategorization:\\nYour content should be clearly categorized into specific and relevant categories.\\xa0 In the post editor screen, click on “Document” on the right menu, and then go down to “Categories” and “Add New Category”.\\nPermalinks:\\nEach blog post “slug” is the end portion of the URL. You want to make sure each post has a defined slug and doesn’t end with an article number. You can easily change this in your WordPress dashboard by going to “Settings” -> “Permalinks”. Select the “Post Name” option and click “Save Changes”\\nThere are many more factors relating to consider, such as installing something like the\\nYoast WordPress plugin\\n, but these are the big ones that will help improve your search rankings sooner rather than later.\\nFor more tips on promoting your blog make sure to\\ncheck out my in-depth guide to blog promotion\\n.\\nStep 6: Make money from your blog\\nOnce you have put in the effort of creating great blog content and promoting your blog, making money from your blog is actually the easy part.\\nBlogs have the potential to be extremely lucrative, but don’t assume that you’re going to start making money in the first week, or even in the first month. It could take six months to a year to start seeing a steady stream of income. Blogging takes work and dedication, but once you develop a large enough audience, there are several methods you can employ to monetize your blog.\\nSell advertising space\\nOnce you have a popular blog, advertisers will be hounding you for the opportunity to advertise. The best way to take advantage of this situation is to use Google Adsense. Google finds the advertisers for you and all you have to do is place the Google Adsense code on your blog to start running ads. Google Adsense takes all of the hard work out of the process and just cuts you a check.\\nI go into the full details of\\nhow to set up Google Adsense for your WordPress blog here\\n.\\nSell affiliate products\\nAn affiliate program is a commission-based way to advertise. When one of your readers clicks on a link on your blog, they get sent to an advertiser’s site and you earn a commission if they purchase. Affiliate links are a nice way to earn income through the use of product reviews. However, you must remember to disclose that you are an affiliate for the product.\\nSell Products and Services\\nSelling your own products and services directly on your blog is a great way to increase your income. As your blog grows and you begin to see a wide audience, your products and services will begin to sell themselves.\\nUse the sidebar of your blog to increase the visibility of what you sell using visual images and a link to your storefront page.\\nSell digital downloads\\nEbooks, video tutorials, and e-courses are the most commonly consumed digital materials sold by bloggers. With little to no overhead and no shipping costs, you can keep the price low and inviting.\\nIf you are extremely knowledgeable in your field, an ebook can practically write itself. Give it a try, you might surprise yourself!\\nSell memberships\\nAnother way to monetize is by creating membership options on your blog. This allows you to offer members more exclusive content only available with a paid membership. For example, you could offer unlimited downloads of digital goods, free consultations, a private network or forum where community members can mix and mingle, and private content available to members only.\\nThere are many ways a blog can capitalize on popularity and traffic. Choosing the way you monetize from your blog depends on your goals and the purpose of your blog. Those who are selling services, physical goods, and digital goods, for example, may not want to participate in affiliate programs where traffic could be lost to another site.\\nFor more information see my\\nfull guide to making money blogging here\\nNeed more help?\\nI hope this guide has answered any questions you had on how to start your blog, but if any of the steps were unclear to you, you can\\nfind a more detailed version of each step\\nby using the menu at the top right of this page (or at the bottom of this page if you’re on a smartphone).\\nMore\\nspecific tutorials can be found on my blog page\\n.

Blogging is my passion, and I would love to talk with you about it!\\nBlogging FAQ\\nStill have some unanswered questions about blogging?\\xa0 Below are the most common questions I get about starting a new blog.\\xa0 If you can’t find an answer to your question here, feel free to send me an email via my\\ncontact page\\n, or leave a comment below.\\nClick on a question to read the answer:\\nWhat makes a successful blog?\\nYou. It is your passion, your creativity, your knowledge and expertise, and what you bring to the community that makes a blog successful. As long as you provide content that is interesting, informative, and engaging to the readers you’re looking to connect with, your success is only limited by the number of posts you’re able to produce.\\nKeep writing, keep interacting, keep engaging, and your blog quickly become one of the success stories. As long as you’re passionate about the subject matter, the sky is the limit.\\nWhat do you need to start a blog?\\nTime, passion, and a clear goal.\\nBlogging is nearly a full-time operation. A successful blogger commits to posting lengthy and detailed content at least weekly. Promoting the blog must also be done regularly across social accounts and through peer interactions.\\nEqually important is the passion behind your blog. To come up with great content on a regular basis your blog should revolve around a topic that you are obsessed with. You don’t have to be the leading authority on the subject matter. You only need to possess passion, excitement, dedication, and deeply rooted opinions.\\nYou also need a clear goal in mind. What is the main objective of your blog? Is it to inform the public? To eventually retain paid subscribers? With a clear final objective you can grow a blog that satisfies these goals in the long term.\\nWhat should my blog be about?\\nAnswer these questions:\\nWhat are you passionate about? What do you think about daily? What topic do you annoy all of your friends, family, and co-workers with on a regular basis? What do you find yourself dreaming about? What do you find yourself constantly researching? What do you read about?\\nIf there is a common denominator in your answers to these questions – THAT is what your blog should be about.\\nYour blog should be about what interests you – what you’re passionate about. And once you begin to build your blog, no matter what the subject material, you will find a community of people who are interested in what you have to say.\\nHow do I find a profitable niche for my blog?\\nIf you know the general topic for your blog, a simple way of making your niche more profitable is by narrowing the niche to eliminate competition.\\nFor example, let’s say you’re passionate about food and you want to start by creating a recipe blog. You’ll be competing with a million recipe blogs. So let’s narrow that topic down to something that is more manageable yet still important to a lot of people. Making the topic of your blog more specific will help to eliminate a lot of competition and elevate your blog results in search engines for more specific queries.\\nHow do I name my blog?\\nThis can ultimately be a fun exercise.\\nAs an example, let’s say your blog will be about custom pet gift baskets. In this instance, let’s list all the main words this blog will be about.\\nNow let’s list some variant synonyms of these words. Use a thesaurus if need be!\\nNow list nouns and adjectives that apply to you as the creator.\\nNow start putting words together, introduce new words, and keep playing around until you come up with a name you like!\\nIf you are still struggling you can always try using a blog name generator for additional ideas.\\nWhat do you do if your domain name is taken?\\nIf the domain name you want is taken and the full web address is your trademarked business name, you can assert your trademark rights and privileges and eventually get this domain handed over to you. It is a lengthy process that will involve lawyers and hefty fees, but as long as the name is trademarked by you, you would likely win the domain name.\\nIf your name isn’t trademarked, don’t attempt to buy the .info or .biz variation of the domain. Instead, try a slight variation of the domain name such as adding a dash between words, or inserting the word “the” or other nominal words.\\nIn some cases, the domain is owned but isn’t being used. Trying searching for it in the browser. If the URL is pointed to a different domain, it isn’t being used, only redirected. You may be able to buy the domain for the right price from the current owner. If the domain is parked, you may also attempt to purchase the domain.\\nWhere is the best place to create a blog?\\nIn the tutorial on this page I show you how to create your blog using\\nBlueHost\\nand\\nWordPress.org\\n.\\xa0 This is known as a self-hosted WordPress blog, and it is what I personally use for this blog and it’s what I recommend to all my readers.\\xa0 When you sign-up with BlueHost you get a free domain name, they will automatically install WordPress (WordPress.org) on your BlueHost account. You can begin blogging as soon as your account is set up. You can easily customize your self-hosted WordPress blog just by following the steps in the tutorial on this page.\\nHow much does it cost to start a blog?\\nYou can make a blog for absolutely nothing. It doesn’t cost one red cent.\\nBut let’s be realistic. If you want your blog to be taken seriously, you can’t just get a subdomain from one of the free blogging sites like Blogspot. You’ll want to pick a custom domain name and register it instead. Domain names cost around $15 per year, on average. So now you’re a whopping $15 in the hole.\\nBut the best way to start your blog is through one of the many web hosting companies. The best web hosting choice is a WordPress hosting account through\\nBluehost\\nwhich is $1.99 per month and includes free domain name registration, so your total cost for 1 year is just $33.\\nThese are your main costs associated with starting a successful blog. Of course, you may incur other costs with additional services such as email marketing. As with any business, the biggest expenditure is often advertising, but this would be a cost incurred later on down the road if you choose to go that route.\\nDo bloggers make money?\\nBloggers have the ability to make a full-time income from blogging alone. Some bloggers make hundreds of thousands of dollars. While it isn’t easy to become a highly paid blogger, it is quite possible. As with any business, it takes a lot of hard work and plenty of time.\\nMany bloggers give up on their project after just a few months. They become discouraged when the money doesn’t come in right away, and it almost never does without an instant and immediate following that comes from being a high profile persona. Therefore, time and patience are needed to reach “influencer” status. Those who make money online are the ones who stick with it.\\nThere are several ways a blogger can earn money:\\nAdvertisements\\n:\\nAs your blog gains traction and brings in a healthy amount of daily visitors, advertisers may pay good money for a well-placed ad on your blog.\\nContextual Ads:\\nWith Google Adsense a small piece of code can be placed on your blog that dynamically shows ads related to your content. When one of your readers clicks on an ad the advertiser pays Google, and Google sends you a percentage.\\nAffiliate Programs:\\nAffiliate ads are a very popular way to monetize a blog. These ads lead visitors to a product or service on another website. If a sale resulting from a click on your blog is made, you get a commission, and some commissions can be very high. Affiliate programs can be found on individual stores, or on large-scale platforms such as Amazon.\\nSponsored Posts:\\nAdvertisers can pay a smaller fee to sponsor individual posts rather than advertising on the entire blog. This is a great method for making money on fledgling blogs.\\nHow do bloggers get paid?\\nBloggers are most commonly paid by advertisers. How the blogger is paid varies depending on what type of ads are used.\\nCPC:\\nCPC or “Cost Per Click” ads generate revenue simply through clicks. CPC ads are generally highly targeted and rotational. Ads appear on specific blog posts and are related to the content of that post. The number of clicks you generate, which trends upward as your traffic increases, will ultimately determine the amount you are paid.\\nFlat Fee:\\nIf a blog’s traffic is high, advertisers may pay a monthly flat fee for ad space on the blog’s website. That ad space could appear all over the website, within a section, or just a few pages. The money comes directly from the advertiser.\\nCommission\\n:\\nAds from an affiliate network use affiliate links. These links track visitors that come from your blog to the advertiser’s site. If a purchase is made by a visitor who originated from your blog, you receive a commission.\\nShould I start my blog on WordPress?\\nIf you’re new to blogging and you don’t have much experience with HTML or coding, then yes – self-hosting a WordPress blog is the best choice for you!\\nWhen it comes time to choose a blogging platform, the pros turn to WordPress.\\xa0 And even though WordPress is used by millions of smaller blogs, it also powers many of the biggest sites on the internet.\\xa0 In fact, WordPress is the most popular CMS (Content Management System) in the world with over 75 million blogs and websites currently using it. And there are many reasons why:\\nEasy to Use\\n:\\nWordPress is remarkably easy to use. Theme customizers help to easily design your blog, change colors, and add images. Once your design is complete, all you need to do is write your content. The internal blog editor records your posts and displays them for you.\\nBlog Anywhere\\n: As long as you have Internet access, you can edit your WordPress blog and write new posts. WordPress provides you with an administrative backend where you may log in and work on your blog from anywhere in the world using a PC, Mac, tablet, or smartphone.\\nYou Don’t Need To Know How to Code\\n:\\nWordPress gives you easy tools to set up a blog that looks stunning without knowing a single line of HTML code or hiring a web developer. This makes WordPress a great option for those who don’t want to deal with technical issues.\\nBuilt-in SEO\\n: Google favors blogs built with WordPress. The out-of-the-box SEO (Search Engine Optimization) which comes packed with WordPress delivers impressive results over time in search engines. This translates to more readers for your blog.\\nFree Themes\\n: The WordPress CMS is connected to a repository where thousands of free themes (blog layouts) are available to browse and upload. Directly from the backend of your blog you can browse a multitude of themes with varying styles and functionality. These free WordPress themes can be installed with one click, and then easily customized by a total beginner.\\nIs WordPress free?\\nYes! A self-hosted WordPress blog is a open-source, which is completely free. And there are two different WordPress options, both free, but\\nCOMPLETELY\\ndifferent, which you should be aware of.\\xa0 Choosing between them is one of the most crucial decisions you will make.\\nWordPress.org\\n: This option is completely, 100% free.\\xa0 WordPress.org is the blog platform I show you how to use in the tutorial on this page.\\xa0 While it is completely free to download, it doesn’t run on its own. You will need a web host (see the\\nstep-by-step guide\\n) and you’ll also need to buy a new domain name. Because you need your own web hosting plan, this option is known as a self-hosted WordPress blog. So while WordPress is technically free, there are fees involved with getting your new self-hosted WordPress blog up and running (less than $3 per month).\\nWordPress.com\\n: WordPress.com is a different platform that lets the user create a free blog on a subdomain of WordPress.com. While it does technically let you blog for free, if you would like to enable some basic options, or have your own domain, you will have to upgrade your account to a paid plan.\\xa0 For this and other reasons, I don’t recommend WordPress.com.\\nHow often should I blog?\\nIf your goal is to eventually make money from your blog, you’ll want to start blogging as often as possible – at least once per week. Blogging can be casual if your goal is solely for personal pleasure. But if you’re seeking a large audience and wish to become a leader in your field, blogging weekly is a must.\\nWhile frequency is important, it should not come at the expense of quality.\\xa0 Not every piece of content needs be 2,000 words, but all of your posts should be informative and of value to your audience. This is no easy feat. However, if you’re able to stick with blogging on a regular schedule, it will become easier! As with anything else, the more you do it – the more skilled at it you become.\\nBlogging weekly also helps improve your traffic from search engines, which you can track in your Google Analytics account. When you first begin blogging your latest posts will take time to show up on search engines. As you continue to post regularly you will naturally have more blog posts showing up in the search results, which means more traffic to your blog.\\nWhy do blogs fail?\\nAlmost any blog has the potential to become a success, yet most blogs fail. And there are many reasons why. Here are the most common reasons why a blog fails:\\nGiving Up Too Fast\\n– The most common reason why a blog fails is simply that the content creator gives up before his or her blog even has a chance to become recognized. Before you begin a blog, you should realize that most blogs take months and even years to gain traction. It’s quite an investment. If you fail to gain visitors or make money within a month don’t stop!\\xa0 Continue to focus on creating quality content and getting your name out there via social media and networking.\\nIntermittent Blogging\\n– When there are long “silent periods” between posts it is difficult to build a solid following. People looking for information on your topic usually want a steady stream of new information to keep them interested. When a blog fails to deliver fresh and updated content people get bored and look elsewhere.\\nPoor Content\\n– Some bloggers think they can beat the system with auto-generated content or with duplicate content that is reworded. Readers know fluff when they read it. They know when an article has absolutely no value or when it is simply clickbait. A blog with poor content will never be successful.\\nToo Many Ads\\n– Blogs with dozens of ads obscuring most of the content will deter visitors from returning. People don’t come to your blog to be visually harassed by ill-placed, blinking advertisements. They come for information. While ads a good option to monetize, don’t overdo it.\\nMackenzie\\nsays:\\nAugust 26, 2024 at 5:19 pm\\nHello Scott,\\nThank you so much for this informational and easy to follow blog.

WordPress provides a Privacy Policy generator by default, so it is very easy to add when starting your blog. Beyond that, just make sure you are being transparent with your visitors if you are collecting any information about them.\\nYou may have specific legal issues depending on the topic you are writing about, but for most people just adding a privacy policy page is enough.\\nReply\\nSam\\nsays:\\nNovember 13, 2020 at 8:55 am\\nThis is wonderful! thank you so much for your helpful advice!

Just log-in to the WordPress dashboard of your account and then go “Users” on the left sidebar menu.  From here you can add new users.  You can also give each user different permissions if you so choose. For example, you could be the only administrator of the blog, while still giving other users the permission to write new content.\\nReply\\nHeidi\\nsays:\\nOctober 11, 2020 at 6:09 pm\\nHi Scott, can you use the wordpress from your laptop, tablet and phone to write on-the-go?\\nReply\\nScott Chow\\nsays:\\nNovember 28, 2020 at 12:00 pm\\nYes, you can easily blog from any internet-connected device.

I assure you that I will come back to your site if I decide a blog\\nwould fit my purpose.\\nThank you very much for the great education you have served me.\\nReply\\nScott Chow\\nsays:\\nNovember 28, 2020 at 12:07 pm\\nHi William,\\nA blog sounds the perfect medium for what you want to do.  You can easily write your story and have others comment on it.\\nLet me know if you have any trouble getting started.  I would be happy to assist.\\nReply\\nJeff Peterson\\nsays:\\nOctober 5, 2020 at 7:26 pm\\nThank you for this very informative blog. When setting up the comments section of my blog, is it necessary to ask for a piece of personal info such as the email of the address of the person making the comment? If I let people comment anonymously, this may encourage more people to comment.\\nReply\\nScott Chow\\nsays:\\nNovember 28, 2020 at 12:35 pm\\nHi Jeff,\\nYou can set it up either way.  You are correct that you will get more comments if you don’t ask for an email address, but you will also get more spam comments as well.\\nReply\\nAbraham Victor\\nsays:\\nOctober 2, 2020 at 3:55 am\\nFantastic, and very help. Thank you for such a great help and guidance. You made something impossible possible. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\\nThanks for sharing\\nReply\\nOphelia\\nsays:\\nSeptember 30, 2020 at 4:00 pm\\nCan I start a blog with my phone?\\nReply\\nScott Chow\\nsays:\\nNovember 28, 2020 at 12:11 pm\\nYes, the steps for how to start a blog are the same for phone, tablet, or computer.\\nReply\\nRocky\\nsays:\\nSeptember 30, 2020 at 3:24 pm\\nHi Scott,\\nVery informative post. I am grad student thinking strongly about starting a blog and wanted to know if you could speak to a respectful posting frequency and how many posts are enough before launching?\\nCan you point me to some form of blog management information? I am trying to determine if this is something I can commit to.\\nThank you in advance\\nReply\\nScott Chow\\nsays:\\nNovember 28, 2020 at 2:02 pm\\nHi Rocky,\\nWhen first starting out I suggest posting once or twice a week.  After you have built up a solid readership then you can decrease the posting frequency.  Some really popular blogs only post every couple of months.\\nWhen you first start a blog I recommend launching it as soon as you finish your first post.  This gets you started on growing your readership from day one.\\nReply\\nJoan Kent\\nsays:\\nSeptember 28, 2020 at 2:22 pm\\nGreat synopsis Scott!\\nReply\\nJoan Kent\\nsays:\\nSeptember 28, 2020 at 2:08 pm\\nGreat synopsis of a really BIG subject Scott! Good info for those looking to start blogging.\\nReply\\nGale\\nsays:\\nSeptember 22, 2020 at 11:33 am\\nWhat an excellent blog… I’ve been researching to see if starting a blog is something I want to get into.. I’m retired and do crafts for friends and family.  But ,don’t want to be limited to just blogging about that area.  I’m also an author (inspiration-Christian) and wanted to know if you can have sections when establishing a blog?\\nReply\\nScott Chow\\nsays:\\nNovember 28, 2020 at 1:50 pm\\nHi Gale,\\nYes, the easiest way to do this is to categorize each post.  Your post will then automatically go to the correct category page on your blog.\\nReply\\nCheryl\\nsays:\\nSeptember 22, 2020 at 5:34 am\\nHi Scott,  This is some great help! But I have a question….\\nIf I start a blog is it considered a “side gig”? Or do i have to register a “Business”?\\nHow would I report my income?\\nReply\\nScott Chow\\nsays:\\nNovember 28, 2020 at 1:51 pm\\nHi Cheryl,\\nYou can do it either way.  Most people just start with it as a side hustle, and then as it grows you can consider setting up a business. It would be best to talk to a tax accountant once you get to that point though.\\nReply\\nJeff M\\nsays:\\nSeptember 18, 2020 at 8:54 pm\\nHey Scott. I really appreciate the info, however, both you and BlueHost advertise the cost as “monthly.” When I went to sign up, it gave me a total cost which was the total cost for the contract. Before I give my payment information, I’d like to clarify if I’m paying monthly for the service, or if I have to pay a lump sum. Thanks.\\nReply\\nScott Chow\\nsays:\\nNovember 28, 2020 at 1:53 pm\\nHi Jeff,\\nYes, you will pay up front for the full length of your plan.  So if you do a 12 month plan then you pay for 12 months up front.  You can cancel at anytime and get a pro-rated refund for the unused months on your plan.\\nReply\\nMs. Williams\\nsays:\\nSeptember 17, 2020 at 10:25 pm\\nThank you for all of this information. I’m motivated to start blogging. I am confident that things will go smoothly with all the info that you provided.\\nReply\\nVictor Anthony\\nsays:\\nSeptember 13, 2020 at 6:04 pm\\nThank you Scott. I am so grateful for this enlightening information you have given to me here. I now know how to set up my own blog. But I have a question. Which method of payment does bluehost support when you are paying for the hosting service? And can you choose to pay monthly, or must it be paid yearly? Thanks once again. Please i am expecting your reply.\\nReply\\nScott Chow\\nsays:\\nSeptember 13, 2020 at 6:27 pm\\nHi Victor,\\nA one year package is the shortest option. BlueHost accepts credit cards or PayPal.\\nFeel free to contact me if you have any trouble getting started!\\nReply\\nBruce Dubbink\\nsays:\\nJuly 14, 2020 at 7:45 am\\nHi, Scott!\\nWow!  I think this just might be what I was looking for.  I don’t do social media.  No tweeting, no Facebook, none of that….  But, I know many people that do.  I think they can help get my blog out into the public.\\nA couple of questions – will the basic set up allow for comments?  can I prevent users from leaving comments and delete horrid comments?\\nI am excited and want to be sure I can control some things before I get rolling….\\nThanks!!!\\nReply\\nScott Chow\\nsays:\\nAugust 7, 2020 at 10:43 am\\nHi Bruce,\\nYes, comments are turned-on by default.  You have full control over the comments on your blog. For example, you can have comments automatically approved, or you can choose to manually approve only those that you want.  Of course, you can also turn-off comments completely if you prefer.\\nTo change your comments setting simply go to your blog dashboard and go to “Settings -> Discussion”\\nReply\\nSesilia\\nsays:\\nJune 4, 2020 at 7:42 pm\\nHi Scott, Thank you.  This is very informative.   Can you please help me with  narrowing down a name and topics please?\\nReply\\nScott Chow\\nsays:\\nJune 6, 2020 at 11:45 am\\nSure, just send me a message through my contact page with more details on the topics you are interested in.\\nReply\\nDebra Duplak\\nsays:\\nMay 27, 2020 at 2:52 pm\\nVery informative and easy to follow! I read to the end and then watched video.\\nReply\\nNick Smith\\nsays:\\nMarch 29, 2020 at 9:32 am\\nScott thanks, the tutorial was most helpful. It took me a while but I got there in the end. Good stuff. I used the format you show as it seemed good for me.\\nReply\\nValerie\\nsays:\\nFebruary 12, 2020 at 5:37 pm\\nHi! Thank you so much for this! Your guide is so thorough that I am working on getting my blog up and running! Quick question: How do you create an email with your domain name? I Googled it, but I don’t see the same options in my side panel. On the WordPress article I read, it says to go to Store > Dashboard > Manage emails, but I don’t see that. Thank you for your help!\\nReply\\nScott Chow\\nsays:\\nFebruary 15, 2020 at 8:19 am\\nHi Valerie,\\nHere is a\\nstep-by-step guide to creating a custom email address for your blog\\n.\\nReply\\nFay\\nsays:\\nJanuary 24, 2020 at 4:35 am\\nHi.

Thank you so much for this info. I am very eager to make my own blog but really haven’t a clue where to start or what to blog about. Do you have any recommendations on how to figure out my niche? TIA!\\nReply\\nScott Chow\\nsays:\\nJanuary 23, 2020 at 10:58 am\\nHi April,\\nThe best niche for you is something you have an active interest in.  Think of the things you enjoy spending your time doing and/or learning about.  Travel, fashion, fitness, and food are all popular topics.  Once you figure out what sounds most interesting to you, your job as a blogger is to provide your unique perspective and experience with that topic.  For more detailed info check out\\nthis post on finding your niche\\n.\\nReply\\nPatricia Brock\\nsays:\\nJanuary 22, 2020 at 7:29 pm\\nYour tutorial was so helpful and you are so easy to follow and you have a very good speaking voice.\\nThank you so much for taking the time to have this website, you tube and making yourself available for questions.\\nReply\\nChristiana\\nsays:\\nJanuary 22, 2020 at 3:35 pm\\nHi Scott\\nThank you very much for taking the time to do this. I want to do a blog about fitness and health diet recipes but am not an expert or anything it’s just something i do on daily basis and I feel like I want to start blogging about it even though I know there are tons of fitness blogs out there but I know this is me being me and the routines i go through and I want to know what you think about it. Thanks\\nReply\\nScott Chow\\nsays:\\nJanuary 22, 2020 at 6:41 pm\\nHi Christiana,\\nA blog sounds perfect for your situation.  People enjoy learning about things from someone who is actually doing it, not some armchair expert.\\nYes, there are a lot of fitness blogs already, but that is only because there are also a ton of people who want to read great fitness and health content!\\nBest of luck, and let me know if you need any help along the way.\\nReply\\nSusan Hollister\\nsays:\\nJanuary 21, 2020 at 3:34 pm\\nNewbie question: so what’s the difference between a blog and a website?? Some blogs seem to be “embedded” in a website. Should one create a website first? Then how do you connect the two? Thanks ahead.\\nReply\\nScott Chow\\nsays:\\nJanuary 22, 2020 at 3:54 pm\\nHi Susan,\\nA blog is a type of website.  You are correct, you can have a traditional website and then have a separate section of the site for a blog.  If you are looking for a more traditional website you can\\nfollow my guide to starting a website here\\n.\\nIf you follow the tutorial on this page you will have a blog.  No need to create a separate website first.\\nReply\\nRasheeda Hasan\\nsays:\\nJanuary 19, 2020 at 9:45 am\\nFantastic, and very help. Thank you for such a great help and guidance. You made something impossible possible. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\\nReply\\nJackie Goodfellow\\nsays:\\nJanuary 19, 2020 at 2:05 am\\nThank you so much for your blog. I have had so much fun setting mine up and it might never have happened without your blog. I particularly found the video very clear, concise and helpful.\\nReply\\nAmber Vess\\nsays:\\nJanuary 18, 2020 at 9:19 pm\\nHey.

I’m thinking I may have signed up for the wrong type of blog. I’ve just created a wordpress.com personal blog site (ancestry). I’m just starting the site but am getting notifications that to use ANY plug-ins I need to upgrade to a business account (yikes not inexpensive!). Should I have signed up for WordPress.org??\\nReply\\nScott Chow\\nsays:\\nJanuary 18, 2020 at 7:44 pm\\nHi Sarah,\\nYes, WordPress.org is what you want.
